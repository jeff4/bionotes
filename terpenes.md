## Terpenes, Isoprenes, Steroids, and Sterols

* Both isoprenes and terpenes are alkenes, but derived compounds that include oxygen and other moeities are called *isoprenoids* and *terpenoids*.
* Mini-molecular model kit emphasizes that the entire isoprene unit is planar. Completely flat except for the -CH<sub>3</sub> methyl groups tetrahedral terminal hydrogens.
* [Isoprenes](http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/isoprene/isopreneh.htm) such as [2-methyl-1,3-butadiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprene) are 5-carbon subunits that are used to build up larger molecules like [terpenes](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/chemistry/c3045/client_edit/ppt/PDF/26_07_10.pdf) and ultimately steroids which are lipids.
* Each [terpene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene) has 5n carbons per the biogenetic isoprene rule *aka* the C<sub>5</sub> rule proposed in [1953](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Ružička).

#### Notes from terpene / terpenoid lectures
* [2018 YouTube Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Z1iwhbtBo) by Nandkishor Karade
* Introduction
	* Terpenes and terpenoids are natural products mainly synthesized by plants
	* Contain isoprene (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>) monomers as repeating unit
	* Terpenes are just hydrocarbons
	* Terpenoids contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
	* More than 23,000 terpene systems are known
* Examples of terpenes and terpenoids
	* Myrecene is a major component of Bay Leaves
	* &#945;-Phellandrene is a component of eucalyptus oil
	* [Geraniol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraniol) is the primary component in citronella oil, rose oil, palmarosa oil.
	* [Menthol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menthol) is a monoterpenoid. Made synthetically or obtained fromt eh oils of corn mint, peppermint, or other mints.
	* Carvone in caraway seeds
	* Zingiberene main constituent in ginger
	* Citral is a pleasant sent of lemon
	* &#945;-Pinene and &#946;-Pinene. extracted from pine trees leads to turpentine
