# Patterns and Processes of Vertebrate Evolution
* Author: Robert L. Carroll
* Cambridge Paleobiology Series, 1997

## Chapter 1: Current Problems in Evolutionary Theory
* "Although Darwin's theory sought to deal with evolution over all time scales, almost all of his evidence was drawn from the modern biota." (p. 2)
	* Darwin "argued that both the patterns and processes of evolution were identical over vastly different timescales [aka whether across a dozen generations or over hundreds of millions of generations]." 
	* Darwin's used his famous diagram (reproduced on Carroll p. 3) to convey his hypothesis that "evolution both at the levels of populations and species and over the vast expanse of geological time is characterized by gradual and continuous change." (p. 2)
* But, "the patterns established from  the fossil record of the major groups of vascular plants, vertebrates, and nonvertebrate metazoans are conspicuously different." (p. 2)
	* "There are relatively few major lineages, all of which are very distinct from one another."
	* "Gaps between the lineages indicate that adaptive space is not fully occupied."
	* "Instead of showing gradual and continuous change through time, the major lineages appear suddenly in the fossil record, already exhibiting many of the features by which their modern representatives are recognized.
* "It must be assumed that evolution occurs much more rapidly *between* groups than *within* groups.
