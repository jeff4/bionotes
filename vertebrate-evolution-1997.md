# Patterns and Processes of Vertebrate Evolution
* Author: Robert L. Carroll
* Cambridge Paleobiology Series, 1997

## Chapter 1: Current Problems in Evolutionary Theory
* "Although Darwin's theory sought to deal with evolution over all time scales, almost all of his evidence was drawn from the modern biota....He argued that both the patterns and processes of evolution were identical over vastly different timescales [aka whether across a dozen generations or over hundreds of millions of generations]." (p. 2)
* Darwin's used his famous diagram (reproduced on Carroll p. 3) to convey his hypothesis that "evolution both at the levels of populations and species and over the vast expanse of geological time is characterized by gradual and continuous change." (p. 2)
* But, "the patterns established from  the fossil record of the major groups of vascular plants, vertebrates, and nonvertebrate metazoans are conspicuously different."
