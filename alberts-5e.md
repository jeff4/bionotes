# Molecular Biology of the Cell
* Fifth Edition (2008)
* Authors: Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, and Peter Walter

## Chapter 1: Cells and Genomes
* p. 20 - defintion of **homologs**: All related genes that result from duplication 
	* Duplicate genes that are conserved in two branches after speciation are called **orthologs**
	* Duplicate genes within a single genome are **paralogs**
	* Orthologs and paralogs are subsets of the larger containing set of homologs
* **Dehydration Synthesis** (aka Condensation Synthesis) vs. **Hydrolysis**. See Alberts 5e Fig. 2-64 and 2-65 on p. 85, Alberts 5e Fig. 2-19 on p. 57, and JH handwritten notes (8/22/2020)

## Chapter 2: Cell Chemistry and Biosynthesis
### 10 Steps of Glycolysis
* Glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate in 10 steps. 
* For more details, see JH handwritten notes August 7-13, 2020,  Alberts p. 120-121 (Panel 2-8), and [this page](/glycolysis). 

## Chapter 3: Proteins
* See p. 127-129 to see tables and panels of categories of polar vs. nonpolar sidechain/amino acids, acidic vs. basic sidechains, etc.

## Chapter 5: DNA Replication and Repair
*  DNA structure on Panel 2-6 Alberts p. 116-17 and Figure 4-4 and 4-5 on p. 198-199. See also JH handwritten notes 8/26/2020.
