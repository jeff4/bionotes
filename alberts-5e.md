# Molecular Biology of the Cell
* Alberts et al., Fifth Edition (2008)
* p. 20 - defintion of **homologs**: All related genes that result from duplication 
	* Duplicate genes that are conserved in two branches after speciation are called **orthologs**
	* Duplicate genes within a single genome are **paralogs**
	* Orthologs and paralogs are subsets of the larger containing set of homologs
* **Dehydration Synthesis** (aka Condensation Synthesis) vs. **Hydrolysis**. See Alberts 5e Fig. 2-64 and 2-65 on p. 85, Alberts 5e Fig. 2-19 on p. 57, and JH handwritten notes (8/22/2020)

### 10 Steps of Glycolysis

Glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate in 10 steps. For more details, see JH handwritten notes August 7-13, 2020,  Alberts p. 120-121 (Panel 2-8), and [this page](/glycolysis). 


## Chapter 3: Proteins
* See p. 127-129 to see tables and panels of categories of polar vs. nonpolar sidechain/amino acids, acidic vs. basic sidechains, etc.
