## List of Excluded Inventions 
* [www.bionotes.org](www.bionotes.org)
	* All content I've published as personal notes at www.bionotes.org as of September 1, 2022.
	* Ongoing content I publish on this site after September 1, 2022.
	* The vast majority of the content on this site is unrelated to my employment at Stackbit, headless content management systems, and the CMS industry in general. The only possible exception is that I have occasionally taken notes on publicly available courses regarding general marketing topics that are not specific to Stackbit or its business.

	* Personal blog that I may start posting to again. None of the content is specific to Stackbit or its business.
* Instagram and related social media accounts related to Daily Molecule
	* [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/dailymolecule/) primarily about organic chemistry but with some content on pure math. All this content is unrelated to my employment at Stackbit.
