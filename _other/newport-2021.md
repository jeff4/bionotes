* Author: Cal Newport

### Introduction: The Hyperactive Hive Mind
* 2010 story of Nish Acharya, Federal Government's director of innovation and entrepreneurship under Barack Obama. How Acharya's tenure began with an unplanned email blackout of 6 weeks.
	* Acharya experience inconvenience, FOMO on important meetings, and challenges scheduling meetings (p. xii)
	* But he also "began to notice that he was actually getting *better* at his job" (p. xii)
	* Acharya noticed that because he did not have an inbox to check, he had "whitespace" aka "cognitive downtime" that allowed him to "dive more deeply into the research literature relevant to the topics handled by his office." (p. xiii)
	* Newport pitched the possibility of working this way–entirely without email–permanently and Acharya needed time to process this because it was so shocking (p. xiii)
* Standard default hypothesis: If one feels overwhelmed by email (or Slack or Microsof Teams, etc.)  "its because your personal habits are sloppy: you need to batch your inbox checks, and turn off your notifications, and write clearer subject lines! If inbox overload gets really bad, then maybe your organization as a whole needs to tweak their 'norms' around issues like response time expectations." (p. xiv)
	* But what if the opposite is true?
	* "What if email didn't sae knowledge work but instead **accidentally traded minor conveniences for a major drag on real productivity (actual results)**, leading to slower economic growth"?
	* "What if our problems with these toolsdon't come from easily fixable bad habits and loose norms, bu instead from the way they dramatically and unexpectedly changed the very nature of how we work?"
* Newport's 2016 [*Deep Work*](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) argued that we undervalue concentration and that rapid, frequent, easy digital communication created frequent distractions. 
	* He assumed that the problem was insufficient knowledge and prioritization; "once organizations realized the importance of focus, they could easily correct their operations to make it a priority."
	* He was wrong. Instead, "constant communication is not something that gets in the way of real work; it has instead become totally intertwined in how this work actually gets done–preventing easy efforts to reduce distractions through better habits or short-lived management stunts like email-free Fridays.
* [2019 Radicati Group report](https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Email-Statistics-Report-2011-2015-Executive-Summary.pdf) says that the average worker is sending and receiving 125 business emails per day aka about 1 message every 4 minutes.(p. xvi)
* [Adobe 2018 Consumer Email Survey](https://www.slideshare.net/adobe/2018-adobe-consumer-email-survey) found that knowledge workers self-report "spending more than 3 hours per day sending and receiving business email." (p. xvii)
