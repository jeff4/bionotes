## 0. Introduction
* What is digital marketing
	
## 1. The Digital Marketing Framework 
* The Building Blocks of Digital Marketing
	* Paid Media
	* Owned Media
	* Earned Media


## 2. Digital Marketing Basics
* How to develop a marketing strategy--know your product, know your customer, know how your product solves your target customer's problem, know your differentiation counter to existing customer
* How to define your value proposition
	* Example of Uber. Sub bullets talked about pain points. But headline just summed it up as "The Smartest way to get around". Sub-bullets each directly address a specific pain with incumbent taxis:
		* One tap and the car comes directly to you
		* Your driver knows exactly where to go
		* Payment is completely cashless
	* Example value prop for an imaginary new smartwatch 
* How to identify your target market
	* Customer segmentation
* How to create your customer persona
	* Ficitious person as an avatar. Every customer segment should have a persona that fits on a single page.
	* Four questions about ideal customer: (1) Who are they?; (2) What needs do they have; (3) What barriers do they need to overcome?; (4) What motivates them? 
	* important to have a story and attach photo / picture
* How to establish goals for digital marketing
	* What are the attributes of a useful; actionable goal? SMART acronym
		* S = specific
		* M = measurable
		* A = attainable
		* R = relevant
		* T = time bound
	* This is where he talks about OKRs
* How to developer your digital marketing KPIs
	* granular success metrics. aka, Overall Goals are SMART. They are measured by OKRs and Key Results usually occur on the deadline per quarter. The granular metrics that roll up to OKRs are KPIs.
	* Assume that we are trying to achieve quarterly KPI Goal of selling 250 coffee mugs online. There are 2 supporting activites: (1) running online ads and (2) running email campaigns. Online ads might have a kpi of achieving $8 CPA cost per acquisition. Email campaign might have KPIs for open rate or or CTA clickthroughs
	* With online sales, likely going to look at conversion rate and CPA.
	* For broader marketing objectives, KPI for total revenue and even the ratio of new to returning visitors.
	* Make sure you make these KPIs available in a shareable document which enforces that it be easy to understand
* How to draft a one page marketing plan
	* " As your marketing strategy shapes up, you'll need a place to park all the information you're capturing. It needs to be agile, easy to update, and very simple to distribute. Now, I use a very simple, one-page template to help with this exercise. This is meant to put your problems front and center, so you can generate effective ideas. 
	* "It'll live alongside your buyer journey map and your persona documents. Here's what it looks like. You have a series of boxes that you'll fill out, and it's divided up so that the left side of the page is all about your product or service, and the right side is all about the market. Let's walk through these fields together. 
	* "In the problem box, list one to three high priority problems that your customers have, and below them, list any existing solutions that try to solve those problems. In the customer segments box, list the personas that you're targeting. From here, the solutions box is where you'll list one to three ways that your product or service solves the consumer's problems. Now, from here, you'll fill out your unique value proposition, and this is right in the middle, as it lives both between your product or service and your market. 
	* "Next, list all of your channels. This is your path to the customer, and it's how you'll communicate the existence of what you're selling, and pick the channels that your customer segments are spending the most time with. 
	* "Now...you'll need to outline your revenue streams. How are you going to make money? What's the lifetime value of your customer? What's the gross margin on whatever it is you're selling? And now, just to the left is your cost structure, and this is where you'll list the operational costs for making the business get all the way to market. How much will it cost to acquire your customer? How much does it cost to run the business? How much are you going to be spending on marketing? 
	* "Next up, key metrics. Every business must have key metrics that are used to monitor performance. List what activities you'll be measuring that are going to demonstrate that you're successful in your marketing efforts.  
	* "Finally, the unfair advantage. What do you do so insanely well that nobody can copy you, or that puts you way ahead of the competition? I want you to take 20 minutes and put together a one-page marketing plan. Now, there's a ton of resources online with editable templates if you need one. Just run a Google search for lean canvas templates, but I want you to build one at least once. It is a fantastic exercise that can help bring some clarity to the chaos that is marketing." 	


## 3. Digital Marketing Key Concepts
* Persuading with data
* How analytics work in digital marketing
* How to capture key insights in your digital marketing

## 4. Digital Marketing Hub and Spokes
* How to outline your online marketing presence
	* "Content sits at the core of your digital marketing strategy. Your entire online presence is built around your website, maps listings, mentions on blogs, in social media channels, through ads and emails, and well, that's all content. 
	* "But organizing and planning for the content you need can get overwhelming fast. So what you want is a blueprint of the different places where you'll be distributing content. I like to use a hub and spokes model to simplify. Now much like a bicycle wheel, this model has a hub in the middle, the most essential part, and spokes that extend out and support the wheel. 
	* "So at the core of your digital marketing strategy is your owned media. It's the content that you own and host on your platforms. Blogs are great in digital marketing, they represent a cheap and easy way to control the conversation. And you can write about your company and your team, product launches, industry developments, events you're hosting, and so on. You control the style of your writing and you can focus on the areas that you believe will appeal to your target audience. 
	* "That content in your hub is entirely under your control. You create it, you can edit it, and you manage it. That whole conversation in short is something that you own, but that message needs to get distributed. So you select your spokes and the spokes represent the digital channels you'll use to distribute that message. You'll want to select the platforms that you can actively use. 
	* "Ask yourself where your target audience hangs out and the channels that they're interacting with. Also, be sure to check where your competitors are active. Say for example, several of your spokes are social media. While you can manage your business accounts within social media, you're going to have less control over the audience that interacts with you. Social networks encourage engagement and conversation, but what you lose in control, you'll gain in amplification and reach of your message. 
	* "Now it can feel like the more spokes, the better, but remember, every spoke needs management. If you don't have the resources, it's better to stick with just a few spokes and maintain those rather than setting up your presence in many platforms and losing control over the conversation or looking as if you're no longer active. As you think through your digital marketing strategy, consider using a simple hub and spokes blueprint for your initial model. 
* How to decide on a marketing channel
	* "It's impossible to be active in every marketing channel. So you have to select the ones that make the most sense for your business. And in order to do that, you'll need to understand the platforms that you have access to and how they might benefit you. 
	* "Now, this is a pivotal challenge in digital marketing. There are an endless array of channels. Some are big and have been around for a while and some are smaller and maybe newer too. You have everything from the major social media outlets down to very niche forums and groups. And what's going to work for you is really highly dependent on your audience. 
	* "As a marketer, you'll need to go where your customer is but also where it makes sense to be active as a brand. Now, as you map out potential channels, I also suggest that you consider what mindset your customer is in while they're on that channel. 
	* "Let's say you sell aftermarket parts for off-roading enthusiasts. A 30-minute product demonstration on YouTube might be really effective and enjoyable for a prospect already invested in YouTube. But for a restaurant, well, YouTube is less likely to return on that same investment. 
	* "Now, it can be tempting to pursue a channel simply because it's popular but don't let yourself or stakeholders persuade you to over-invest in any channel that isn't the right fit for your consumer or what you're selling. Make an investment into exploring channels that are available to you. If they're new and foreign, well, join as an observer and follow other brands. Treat it like moving to a new town. Find a few locals to help you make the transition. Above all, invest in channels where your message lands with the right audience, where they're most likely going to be engaging with it.
* How to prioritize in marketing
	* "Face it, there are so many channels to choose from that it can be overwhelming to know where to start, and how to narrow down the list. 
	* "Now, marketing channels are how you distribute your message.  And your goal is to identify which marketing channels should belong on your list, and which ones you just can't accommodate. And you can't, and shouldn't be everywhere simultaneously. 
	* "So to decide which channels are worth your time, I like to use a scoring model popularized by Sean Ellis called ICE, which stands for Impact, Confidence and Ease. When you multiply these together, you'll get a score that lets you rank where to invest your time first. 
	* "Here's how it works, you'll set up a simple table with five columns. The first column will contain the marketing idea or channel. The second a score for impact. The third, a score for confidence. The fourth, ease and the fifth will be the total score. 
	* "For each idea, you're going to estimate the impact, the confidence, and the ease on a scale of 1 to 10. For impact, you're going to be asking yourself how much of an improvement will this have? In other words, how significantly will it contribute to your marketing goals? You score it 1, if it's very little impact and 10, if it's going to be a game changer. 
	* "Next, you'll need to indicate your confidence that this impact metric is as you've guessed. So how confident are you that this will have very little impact, or be that total game changer? I like to use a rule of thumb here. O means this is strictly a hunch. 1 to 2 is anecdotal, 3 to 4 means you'll have market data, 5 to 6 hard evidence, and anything over a 7 is almost a near guarantee. 
	* "From here, indicate the ease. How much time and effort will it take? O is incredibly difficult, and 10 is effortless. And from here, it's super easy. Multiply the numbers across, and then sort the ideas from the highest score to the lowest. This way, you can quickly determine which of the objectives are a priority. 
	* "This process can be incredibly helpful in getting you out of analysis paralysis and helping identify where to take immediate action.
* How to create powerful marketing messaging
	* "Your messaging is how a consumer comes to interact with your product or service to decide if it's right for them. Your messaging is present at every stage of the funnel, from the first visit to your website, to their decision to purchase. 
	* "Even the best products or services will fail if your messaging doesn't connect with your audience. It's really hard to change an opinion once it's been formed. So if you misstep in creating messaging, it'll be a real challenge to unwind the damage. So what you need to do is first think through your messaging strategically. 
	* "Now, one of the main attributes of strategic messaging is consistency. The best message is always simple and consistent, but also it's going to be in line with how your current customers describe what it is you do, and why you do it well. 
	* "If you're perplexed as to whether your messaging aligns with how others present you, I have a simple exercise for you. Ask your team, close customers, and even close colleagues who understand the business you're in, to send you an email with one sentence, answering the following questions. 
	* "What is it that we do? What is the problem we are solving? How are we different from our competitors? And why should customers buy from us, or why did you buy from us? Use this to find gaps in your messaging. 
	* "Then, as you go about developing any content, I want you to be sure that your messaging follows these five best practices. 
	* "**One**, tell a good, convincing story. Storytelling captures people attention and motivates them to take action, and to be convincing, well, you'll need to make sure that your product or brand comes across as trustworthy, confident, empathetic, and composed. 
	* "**Two**, appeal to emotion. People buy on emotion, and then they justify with fact. So remember to focus on outcomes that are inspirational, aspirational, or would represent a significant milestone for a person or their company.  
	* "**Three**, be consistent. Consistent messages are more memorable. Repeat a simple message over and over again, and don't change it all that much. 
	* "**Four**, be clear, avoid fancy words, and always use more conventional language when possible. 
	* "**Five**, be obvious. Don't assume that your audience understand terms that you use in your communication. Use obvious words, or define the ones that aren't obvious Be sure that your message contains a flavor of your value proposition, and use the same tone and theme across all of your marketing platforms. Understand your audience, tell a great story, and be authentic.
* How to create lean messaging in marketing copy
	* "If you want your messaging to be really effective and resonate with your audience, well, your marketing copy should be accessible and lean. If I were to visit your website or receive your newsletter or even see your latest Linkedln post, I shouldn't be drowning in big words. 
	* "Complex and verbose messages don't make you or your brand sounds smart. In fact, they might make you sound a little out of touch. Nobody likes to read complex jargon. Now, it's one thing to use industry terms, but it's another to string together business jargon. 
	* "Instead, give visitors something that draws them in and keeps them focused on what you have to offer. The best messaging is short, concise, and to the point.  Now, it can still be the voice of your brand, but the jargon has to go. And when it comes to accessible content, it's also important you're considering the assumptions that you're making. 
	* "You see, we make lots of decisions daily, and rarely do we ever have every answer and every piece of information available. So we rely on our gut or our intuition to guide us. Well, our intuition is built by our experiences and associations over time. And this will lead us to have preconceived notions which impact every buying decision we make. 
	* "And this is why as you craft marketing messages, you need to ask yourself what messaging assumptions have been made. **For example, many people still assume that eco-friendly cleaning products are not as effective as they're synthetic competitors. And while this is likely an incorrect theory, it's actually a widely held belief.** 
	* "The reality is, regardless of what you sell your consumers are going to make assumptions, if you don't fill in the gaps for them. So it's on you to make sure that your messaging tells the complete picture. If you know that consumers assume eco-friendly cleaning products are weaker, then you must front load the messaging that dictates they're just as strong, if not stronger. 
	* "Don't let your consumers trip over their own assumptions, but also, don't bog them down with too many complex words.
