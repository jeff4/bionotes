## 0. Introduction
* What is digital marketing
	
## 1. The Digital Marketing Framework 
* The Building Blocks of Digital Marketing
	* Paid Media
	* Owned Media
	* Earned Media


## 2. Digital Marketing Basics
* How to develop a marketing strategy--know your product, know your customer, know how your product solves your target customer's problem, know your differentiation counter to existing customer
* How to define your value proposition
	* Example of Uber. Sub bullets talked about pain points. But headline just summed it up as "The Smartest way to get around". Sub-bullets each directly address a specific pain with incumbent taxis:
		* One tap and the car comes directly to you
		* Your driver knows exactly where to go
		* Payment is completely cashless
	* Example value prop for an imaginary new smartwatch 
* How to identify your target market
	* Customer segmentation
* How to create your customer persona
	* Ficitious person as an avatar. Every customer segment should have a persona that fits on a single page.
	* Four questions about ideal customer: (1) Who are they?; (2) What needs do they have; (3) What barriers do they need to overcome?; (4) What motivates them? 
	* important to have a story and attach photo / picture
* How to establish goals for digital marketing
	* What are the attributes of a useful; actionable goal? SMART acronym
		* S = specific
		* M = measurable
		* A = attainable
		* R = relevant
		* T = time bound
	* This is where he talks about OKRs
* How to developer your digital marketing KPIs
	* granular success metrics. aka, Overall Goals are SMART. They are measured by OKRs and Key Results usually occur on the deadline per quarter. The granular metrics that roll up to OKRs are KPIs.
	* Assume that we are trying to achieve quarterly KPI Goal of selling 250 coffee mugs online. There are 2 supporting activites: (1) running online ads and (2) running email campaigns. Online ads might have a kpi of achieving $8 CPA cost per acquisition. Email campaign might have KPIs for open rate or or CTA clickthroughs
	* With online sales, likely going to look at conversion rate and CPA.
	* For broader marketing objectives, KPI for total revenue and even the ratio of new to returning visitors.
	* Make sure you make these KPIs available in a shareable document which enforces that it be easy to understand
* How to draft a one page marketing plan
	* " As your marketing strategy shapes up, you'll need a place to park all the information you're capturing. It needs to be agile, easy to update, and very simple to distribute. Now, I use a very simple, one-page template to help with this exercise. This is meant to put your problems front and center, so you can generate effective ideas. 
	* "It'll live alongside your buyer journey map and your persona documents. Here's what it looks like. You have a series of boxes that you'll fill out, and it's divided up so that the left side of the page is all about your product or service, and the right side is all about the market. Let's walk through these fields together. 
	* "In the problem box, list one to three high priority problems that your customers have, and below them, list any existing solutions that try to solve those problems. In the customer segments box, list the personas that you're targeting. From here, the solutions box is where you'll list one to three ways that your product or service solves the consumer's problems. Now, from here, you'll fill out your unique value proposition, and this is right in the middle, as it lives both between your product or service and your market. 
	* "Next, list all of your channels. This is your path to the customer, and it's how you'll communicate the existence of what you're selling, and pick the channels that your customer segments are spending the most time with. 
	* "Now...you'll need to outline your revenue streams. How are you going to make money? What's the lifetime value of your customer? What's the gross margin on whatever it is you're selling? And now, just to the left is your cost structure, and this is where you'll list the operational costs for making the business get all the way to market. How much will it cost to acquire your customer? How much does it cost to run the business? How much are you going to be spending on marketing? 
	* "Next up, key metrics. Every business must have key metrics that are used to monitor performance. List what activities you'll be measuring that are going to demonstrate that you're successful in your marketing efforts.  
	* "Finally, the unfair advantage. What do you do so insanely well that nobody can copy you, or that puts you way ahead of the competition? I want you to take 20 minutes and put together a one-page marketing plan. Now, there's a ton of resources online with editable templates if you need one. Just run a Google search for lean canvas templates, but I want you to build one at least once. It is a fantastic exercise that can help bring some clarity to the chaos that is marketing." 	


## 3. Digital Marketing Key Concepts
* Persuading with data
* How analytics work in digital marketing
* How to capture key insights in your digital marketing

## 4. Digital Marketing Hub and Spokes
* How to outline your online marketing presence
	* "Content sits at the core of your digital marketing strategy. Your entire online presence is built around your website, maps listings, mentions on blogs, in social media channels, through ads and emails, and well, that's all content. 
	* "But organizing and planning for the content you need can get overwhelming fast. So what you want is a blueprint of the different places where you'll be distributing content. I like to use a hub and spokes model to simplify. Now much like a bicycle wheel, this model has a hub in the middle, the most essential part, and spokes that extend out and support the wheel. 
	* "So at the core of your digital marketing strategy is your owned media. It's the content that you own and host on your platforms. Blogs are great in digital marketing, they represent a cheap and easy way to control the conversation. And you can write about your company and your team, product launches, industry developments, events you're hosting, and so on. You control the style of your writing and you can focus on the areas that you believe will appeal to your target audience. 
	* "That content in your hub is entirely under your control. You create it, you can edit it, and you manage it. That whole conversation in short is something that you own, but that message needs to get distributed. So you select your spokes and the spokes represent the digital channels you'll use to distribute that message. You'll want to select the platforms that you can actively use. 
	* "Ask yourself where your target audience hangs out and the channels that they're interacting with. Also, be sure to check where your competitors are active. Say for example, several of your spokes are social media. While you can manage your business accounts within social media, you're going to have less control over the audience that interacts with you. Social networks encourage engagement and conversation, but what you lose in control, you'll gain in amplification and reach of your message. 
	* "Now it can feel like the more spokes, the better, but remember, every spoke needs management. If you don't have the resources, it's better to stick with just a few spokes and maintain those rather than setting up your presence in many platforms and losing control over the conversation or looking as if you're no longer active. As you think through your digital marketing strategy, consider using a simple hub and spokes blueprint for your initial model. 
* How to decide on a marketing channel

* How to prioritize in marketing
	* "Face it, there are so many channels to choose from that it can be overwhelming to know where to start, and how to narrow down the list. 
	* "Now, marketing channels are how you distribute your message.  And your goal is to identify which marketing channels should belong on your list, and which ones you just can't accommodate. And you can't, and shouldn't be everywhere simultaneously. 
	* "So to decide which channels are worth your time, I like to use a scoring model popularized by Sean Ellis called ICE, which stands for Impact, Confidence and Ease. When you multiply these together, you'll get a score that lets you rank where to invest your time first. 
	* "Here's how it works, you'll set up a simple table with five columns. The first column will contain the marketing idea or channel. The second a score for impact. The third, a score for confidence. The fourth, ease and the fifth will be the total score. 
	* "For each idea, you're going to estimate the impact, the confidence, and the ease on a scale of 1 to 10. For impact, you're going to be asking yourself how much of an improvement will this have? In other words, how significantly will it contribute to your marketing goals? You score it 1, if it's very little impact and 10, if it's going to be a game changer. 
	* "Next, you'll need to indicate your confidence that this impact metric is as you've guessed. So how confident are you that this will have very little impact, or be that total game changer? I like to use a rule of thumb here. O means this is strictly a hunch. 1 to 2 is anecdotal, 3 to 4 means you'll have market data, 5 to 6 hard evidence, and anything over a 7 is almost a near guarantee. 
	* "From here, indicate the ease. How much time and effort will it take? O is incredibly difficult, and 10 is effortless. And from here, it's super easy. Multiply the numbers across, and then sort the ideas from the highest score to the lowest. This way, you can quickly determine which of the objectives are a priority. 
	* "This process can be incredibly helpful in getting you out of analysis paralysis and helping identify where to take immediate action.
