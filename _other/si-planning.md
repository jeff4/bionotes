per my Wednesday 7/27 phone call with Helena the recruiter, this is what I can expect from each of my 30 minute sessions

* CTO and Co-founder Julianna will want to learn more about my background, my intreests, what have I done. JH interjection: probably *why am i interested in Stytch*??
	* perhaps introduce the idea of Start with Why marketing, and how this evolves over time??
* CEO and co-founder Reed: will ask me about my previous PMM experience and future GTM plans. Prep a lot for this.
* Product mgr, former backened security/identity engineer at Slack and Fast Lydia: will ask about cross-team collaboration
* Growth lead, former Partnerships/BD Spyri will ask about cross team collaboration. I may need to ask her about both current growth challenges/opportunities and what she's seen in the past in terms of Partnership challenges/opportunities.


First, what is the value to the customer? To the various stakeholders? end users, shop owners, and developers?

Second, how is Stytch's value prop's *differentiated* from all the alternatives that are available to their customer? We have to be objective and honest with ourselves about what is special about us. Empathize with the customer and understand them.

Next, how do we encapsulate that positioning? And then how do we test those messages??


## Questions
* What are the biggest challenges for growth?
* Who is responsible for advertising/measurment? How is this balanced between the Marketing team and the Growth team?
* For Partnerships/BD, what has been most effective as a method of outreach, initial approach, and endgame? What have been the bigggest challenges?
* Also for Partnership/BD, what is the ICP that have been most attractive? 

## Ideas
* Managing transition from direct sales, to partners, to channel
* All about finding the right primitives that are composable.
	* Example obviously of when Amazon first architected AWS.
	* What ECL is trying to build. What are the elements of equipment? What are the parts that are supposed to be automated? What are the right software objects???
* From Moore, p. 149: "When most people think of positioning, they are thinking about how to *make their products easier to sell*. But the correct goal is to *make the product easier to buy*.

## Verticals to attack
* Obviously e-commerce and adjacent territories. Research dev shops that focus on this eg. upwork, fiverr. See updated Google Doc for more on this.
* Regarding attacking finance and healthcare. I'd tread somewhat carefully becaus this is big reward, potentially big risk. Costs in terms of making this bullet proof and making sure it meets whatever regulatory requirements there are. Plus different regulatory regimes around the world. That said, may be critical learning experience here that helps us build competitive advantage.
