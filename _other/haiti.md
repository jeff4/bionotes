## Resources for The Black Jacobins Clubhouse Readings
* Daily readings and discussion of *The Black Jacobins* by C.L.R. James, the classic 1938 account of Toussaint L'Ouverture and the San Domingo Revolution, aka the Haitian Revolution, 1791-1804

## Supplemental podcast episodes
* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Duncan_(podcaster)">Mike Duncan's</a> [Revolutions podcast](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/) reviewed the Haitian Revolution back in 2015-2016. I found this podcast to be a great narrative resource to support reading *The Black Jacobins*. One of Duncan's main sources is James' *The Black Jacobins*.
* I find Duncan's website to be a bit hard to navigate so here are direct links to all of the posts about the Haitian Revolution on Duncan's [site](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/).
