### Progress
* 8/18/2021: Back to basics, doing problems in Singh p. 493 - 503, finding eigenvalues using 3B1B 2x2 matrix quicktechnique. Then finding associated eigenvectors by setting up the characteristic equation det(**A** - &#955;**I**) = **0** and then solving the resulting system of equations.
* 8/19: Reviewed fastest way to solve systems of equations, whether Gaussian elimination or others to complete Singh Exercises 7.1.1 p. 503. See this link also for reduced row echelon form [RREF](https://www.usna.edu/Users/math/uhan/sm286a/rref.pdf)
* 8/20: Review of Gaussian elimination problems
* 8/21: More Gauss elimination problems from K. Singh textbook
* 8/22: final gaussian elimination problems. Back to algebraic numeric calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors before more abstract proof versions.
* 8/23: Singh Exercises 7.1 p. 503 to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors
* 8/24: Learned how to solve 4-variable systems more efficiently using Wolfram Alpha as an aid for managing transition between mixed fractions and exact rational number results.
* 9/01: Two eigenvalue/eigenvector problems from Singh 7.2, p. 503
* 9/02: Posted Day 2 of Gaussian elimination
* 9/03: Posted Day 3 of Gaussian elimination and prepped IG post for Saturday
