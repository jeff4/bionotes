* 8/23 Been working on Nathan Jacobson's *Basic Algebra I*, 2nd Edition for the last week or two. Had a nice breakthrough on generalizing Cartesian Products from 2 parent sets to n-parent sets. For example, the coordinate / components of an n-dimensional vector in R<sup>n</sup>
* 8/25 More work on Jacobson / Jake

### 2023 Log
* 1/01/2023 [notes on Peano's Axioms](https://www2.hawaii.edu/~robertop/Courses/TMP/7_Peano_Axioms.pdf) used to formally develop set of natural numbers and related operations by [Roberto Pelayo](https://www2.hawaii.edu/~robertop/pelayo.html) [University of Hawaii site](https://www2.hawaii.edu/~robertop/pelayo.html).
* 1/02 continued on Pelayo's treatment of Peano's Axioms
* 1/03 more on successor functions S()
* 1/04 Downloaded [history of science/math article](https://www.academia.edu/1530661/Peanos_axioms_in_their_historical_context) by Michael Segre. Extensive paper: *Peano's Axiom's in their Historical Context* (1994)

### 2024 Log
* 3/09/2024. Starting over with Math which I've not looked at for about a year, since January 2023. Continuing with Notebook 21 which I started back in Dec 2022. Using Axler 4th edition for this run.
* 3/25/2024. Working on visual proofs for Theorems 3.22 and 3.25.
* 4/01/2024. Began Section 3D on inverse functions, invertibility etc. Also started Notebook #22.
* 4/06/2024. Began Section 5A on eigenspaces. Interesting changes between 3rd and 4th editions wrt when operators are introduced. 3rd edition introduces operators in Section 3D; 4th Ed introduces them at beginning of 5A. 
* 4/07 Reviewed definition of invariant maps and invariant subspaces from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_subspace). Wiki also introduces the terminology of calling a subspace **W** 'T-invariant' because a space **W** is only invariant with respect to a specific map T.
* 4/08 Also looked at eigen calculations in Singh.
* 4/09 Reviewed G. Strang [YouTube lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdZnhQjJu4I&t=891s) MIT OpenCourseWare on eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Up to 14:50 out of 51:00
