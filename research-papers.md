## Earth Microbiome Project (EMP)
* Plan to sequence representative samples of [all Bacteria and Archaea](https://press.igsb.anl.gov/earthmicrobiome/)
* Slow acceptance of Carl Woese's 1977 new classification system with three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology)#Eukaryotic_supergroups">Eukarya</a>.
	* As late as 1998, [Ernst Mayr was still advocating](https://www.pnas.org/content/95/17/9720) the re-unification of the Bacteria and Archaea domains back into a single taxon called Prokaryota.

Danchin, [*Lateral gene transfer in eukaryotes: tip of the iceberg or of the ice cube?*](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-016-0330-x) suggests that minimal LGT has happened recently in Eukaryota. However, common not just within Archaea and Bacteria but *between* those two domains as well even in relatively recent times</del>
* 12/13/2020: <del>* 2007 Rose and Oakley, [*The New Biology: Beyond The Modern Synthesis*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18036242/). Excellent review of how 21st century biology is a reintegration on the order of Darwin in 1859, Modern Synthesis in mid-20th century. Also very helpful reviewers comments in the same PDF by [Doolitle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Doolittle) and [Eugene V. Koonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Koonin) esp. with regard to microbiology, bacterial LGT, etc. Also Koonin and authors debate how helpful it might be to call this new biology "Postmodern BIology".</del>
