12/13/2020: * 2007 Rose and Oakley, The New Biology: Beyond The Modern Synthesis. Excellent review of how 21st century biology is a reintegration on the order of Darwin in 1859, Modern Synthesis in mid–20th century. Also very helpful reviewers comments in the same PDF by Doolitle and Eugene V. Koonin esp. with regard to microbiology, bacterial LGT, etc. Also Koonin and authors debate how helpful it might be to call this new biology “Postmodern BIology”.
