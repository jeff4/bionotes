# [What Is The Tree of Life?](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005912) 

## Nearly Universal Trees and the Statistical Tree of Life
* See p. 3 for following terms.
	* **TOL** = Tree of Life
	* **FOL** = Forest of Life
	* 102 **NUTs** = Nearly Universal Trees
	* **STOL** = the Statistical Tree of Life
	* Complexity hypothesis (p. 3 of 7)
		* "The **complexity hypothesis** is the notion that genes whos products interact with the products of many others will have so many coevolved molecular dependencies that [those genes'] function in a distantly related cellular environment is impaired."
		* Therefore, "*connectivity* (as defined by the number of protein-protein interactions)...is the key determinnat and there are highly connected systems other than translation in many cells."
		* "So it may be equally relevant that translation and transciption are conservative and essential cellular activites, while may frequently transferred genes unction in "optional" metabolic systems, representing alternative and therefore evolutionarily more changeable ways cells can make livings."
	
## Pangenomics
* count of "core genes" and similarity/difference of gene complements across various species in the genus *Escherichia* as compared to non bacteria.
