# [The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction)

## Main ideas
 * History of invention of lithography in the early 19th century but then followed just a few decades later by photography
 * Concept of aura
 * Film as mass medium where people can laugh together
 * Fascism leads to aestheticization of politics. Whereas Communism leads to politicization of art to see it as a means of communication, exhortation, and education.
 
## Quotes
* "First, process reproduction is more independent of the original than manual reproduction.
	* "For example, in photography, process reproduction can bring out those aspects of the original that are unattainable to the naked eye yet accessible to the lens, which is adjustable and chooses its angle at will. And photographic reproduction, with the aid of certain processes, such as enlargement or slow motion, can capture images which escape natural vision.
* "Secondly, technical reproduction can put the copy of the original into situations which would be out of reach for the original itself. Above all, it enables the original to meet the beholder halfway, be it in the form of a photograph or a phonograph record. The cathedral leaves its locale to be received in the studio of a lover of art; the choral production, performed in an auditorium or in the open air, resounds in the drawing room.
* "The situations into which the product of mechanical reproduction can be brought may not touch the actual work of art, yet the quality of its presence is always depreciated. This holds not only for the art work but also, for instance, for a landscape which passes in review before the spectator in a movie.
* "...that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art.
* "These two processes lead to a tremendous shattering of tradition which is the obverse of the contemporary crisis and renewal of mankind.
* "The uniqueness of a work of art is inseparable from its being imbedded in the fabric of tradition. This tradition itself is thoroughly alive and extremely changeable. An ancient statue of Venus, for example, stood in a different traditional context with the Greeks, who made it an object of veneration, than with the clerics of the Middle Ages, who viewed it as an ominous idol.
