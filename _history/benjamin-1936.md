# [The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction)

## Main ideas
 * History of invention of lithography in the early 19th century but then followed just a few decades later by photography
 * Concept of aura
 * Film as mass medium where people can laugh together
 * Fascism leads to aestheticization of politics. Whereas Communism leads to politicization of art to see it as a means of communication, exhortation, and education.
