## Introduction: This Land p. 1
* David Chang: 'Nation, race, and class converged in land.' p. 1
* Patrick Wolfe: 'The question of genocide is  never far from discussion of settler colonialism. Land is life–or, at least, land is necessary for life.' p. 2
* "The history of the United States is a history of settler colonialism–the founding of a state based on the ideology of white supremacy, the widespread practice of African slavery, and a policy of genocide and land theft."
* "Traditionally, historians of the US hoping to have successful careers in academia and to author lucrative textbooks become protectors of this [*Columbian* - poetic Latinate name of the 19th century origin myth from the founding onward] origin myth. With the upheavals in the academic world during the 1960s, engendered by the civil rights movement and student activism, historians came to call for objectivity and fairness in revising interpretations of US history.
* "The warned against moralizing, urging instead a dispassionate and culturally relative approach. 
* Historian Bernard Sheehan, in an influential essay, called for a 'cultural conflict' understanding of Native-Euro-American relations in the early United States, writing that this approach 'diffuses the locus of guilt'. In striving for 'balance', however, historians spouted platitudes: 'There were good and bad people on both sides'. 'American culture is an amalgamation of all its ethnic groups'. 'A frontier is a zone of interaction between cultures, not merely advancing European settlements.'" p. 4
* "Later, trendy postmodernist studies insisted on Indigenous 'agency' under the guise of individual and collective empowerment, making the casualties of colonialism responsible for their own demise. Perhaps worst of all, some claimed (and still claim) that the colonizer and colonized experienced an 'encounter' and engaged in 'dialogue', thereby masking reality with justifications and rationalizations–in short, apologies for one-sided robbery and murder. In focusing on 'cultural change' and 'conflict between cultures', these studies avoid fundamental questions about the formation of the United States and its implications for the present and future. This approach to history allows one to safely put aside present responsibility for continued harm done by that past and the questions of reparations, restitution, and reordering society.
* "Multiculturalism became the cutting edge of post-civil-rights movement US history revisionism. For this scheme to work–and affirm US historical progress–Indigenous nations and communities had to be left out of the picture. As territorially and treaty-based peoples in North America, they did not fit the grid of multiculturalism but were included by transforming them into an inchoate oppressed racial group, while colonized Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans were dissolved into another such group, variously called "Hispanic" or "Latino." The multicultural approach emphasized the 'contributions' of individuals from oppressed groups to the country's assumed greatness. Indigenous peoples were thus credited with corn, beans, buckskin, log cabins, parkas, maple syrup, canoes, hundreds of place names, Thanksgiving, and even the concepts of democracy and federalism. But this idea of the gift-giving Indian helping to establish and enrich the development of the United States **is an insidious smoke screen meant to obscure the fact that the very existence of the country is a result of the looting of an entire continent and its resources**. The fundamental unresolved issues of Indigenous lands, treaties, and sovereignty could not but scuttle the premises of multiculturalism." p. 5
* "With multiculturalism, manifest destiny won the day. As an example, in 1994, Prentice Hall (part of Pearson Education) published a new college-level US history textbook, authored by four members of a new generation of revisionist historians. These radical social historians are all brilliant scholars with posts in prestigious universities. The book's title reflects the intent of its authors and publisher: *Out of Many: A History of the American People*. The origin story of a supposedly unitary nation, albeit now multicultural, remained intact. The original cover design featured a multicolored woven fabric–this image meant to stand in place of the discredited 'melting pot'.
* "With a traditional Navajo dwelling, a hogan, in the background, the woman was shown kneeling in front of a traditional loom, weaving a nearly finished rug. The design? The Stars and Stripes! The authors, upon hearing my objection and explanation that Navajo weavers make their livings off commissioned work that includes the desired design, responded: 'But it's a real photograph'. To the authors' credit, in the second edition they replaced the cover photograph and removed the Navajo picture inside, although the narrative text remains unchanged. 
* "Awareness of the settler-colonialist context of US history writing is essential...The form of colonialism that the Indigenous peoples of North America have experienced was modern from the beginning: the expansion of European corporations, backed by government armies, into foreign areas, with subsequent expropriation of lands and resources. Settler colonialism is a genocidal policy. Native nations and communities, while struggling to maintain fundamental values and collectivity, have from the beginning resisted modern colonialism using both defensive and offensive techniques, including the modern forms of armed resistance of national liberation movements and what now is called terrorism.
* "In every instance, Native nations have fought for survival as peoples. The objective of US colonialist authorities was to terminate their existence as peoples–not as random individuals. This is the very definition of modern genocide as contrasted with premodern instances of extreme violence that did not have the goal of extinction. The United States as a socioeconomic and political entity is a result of this centuries-long and ongoing colonial process. Modern Indigenous nations and communities are societies formed by their resistance to colonialism...It is breathtaking, but no miracle, that they have survived as peoples." p. 6-7
* "To say that the United States is a colonialist settler-state is not to make an accusation but rather to face historical reality, without which consideration not much in US history makes sense, unless Indigenous peoples are erased. **But Indigenous nations, through resistance, have survived and bear witness to this history.**"

### Neocolonialism p. 7
* During the second half of the 20th century, "the former colonial powers and their intellectual apologists mounted a counterforce, often called *neocolonialism*, from which multiculturalism and postmodernism emerged."
	* "Although much revisionist US history reflects neocolonialist strategy–**an attempt to accommodate new realities in order to retain the dominance**–neocolonialist methods signal victory for the colonized.
	* "Such approaches pry off a lid long kept tightly fastened.
	* "One result has been the presence of significant numbers of Indigenous scholars in US universities who are changing the terms of analysis. 
	* "The main challenge for scholars in revising US history in the context of colonialism is not lack of information, nor is it one of methodology. **Rather, the source of the problems has been the refusal or inability of US historians to comprehend the nature of their own history, US history. The fundamental problem is the absence of the colonial framework.**"" p. 7

### Settler Colonialism p. 7-8
	
* "Through economic penetration of Indigenous societies, the European and Euro-American colonial powers created economic dependency and imbalance of trade, then incorporated the Indigenous nations into spheres of influence and controlled them indirectly or as protectorates, with indispensable use of Christian missionaries and alcohol. In the case of US settler colonialism, **land was the primary commodity**. With such obvious indicators of colonialism at work, why should so many interpretations of US political-economic development be convoluted and obscure, avoiding the obvious? p. 7
* "...the twentieth-century emergence of the field of 'US West' or 'Borderlands' history has been forced into an incomplete and flawed settler-colonialist framework. The father of that field of history, FrederickJackson Turner, confessed as much in 1901: 'Our colonial system did not start with the Spanish War [1898]; the U.S. had had a colonial history and policy from the beginning of the Republic; but they have been hidden under the phraseology of *interstate migration* and *territorial organization*.'" p. 7-8
* "The **notion that settler-indigenous conflict is an inevitable product of cultural differences and misunderstandings**, or that violence was committed equally by the colonized and the colonizer, **blurs the nature of the historical processes**. 

### Genocidal policies p. 8-10

* "Euro-American colonialism, an aspect of the capitalist economic globalization, had from its beginnings a genocidal tendency...US history, as well as inherited Indigenous trauma, cannot be understood without dealing with the genocide that the United States committed against Indigenous peoples...The absence of even the slightest note of regret or tragedy in the annual celebration of the US independence betrays a deep disconnect in the consciousness of US Americans." p. 8-9
* "Ojibwe historian Jean O'Brien names the practice of writing Indians out of existence 'firsting and lasting'.
	* "All over the continent, local histories, monuments, and signage narrate the story of first settlement: the founder(s), the first school, first dwelling, first everything, as if there had never been occupants who thrived in those places before Euro-Americans. On the other hand, the national narrative tells of 'last' Indians or last tribes, such as 'the last of the Mohicans', 'Ishi, the last Indian', and *End of the Trail*, as a famous sculpture by James Earle Fraser is titled."
* Four distinct periods of offical genocidal policies by US administrations
	1. Jacksonian period of forced removal (1830s)
	2. California Gold Rush in Northern California (1849-1850s)
	3. post-Civil War era of the so-called Indian wars in the Great Plains (1850s-1870s)
	4. 1950s termination period
* 1873 quote from General William Sherman: 'We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children...during an assault, the soldiers can not pause to distinguish between male and female, or even discriminate as to age.' p. 9-10
* Patrick Wolfe: 'the peculiarity of settler colonialism is that the goal is elimination of Indigenous populations in order to make land available to settlers. That project is not limited to government policy, but rather involves all kinds of agencies, voluntary militias, and the settlers themselves acting on their own.' p. 10
* "There are more than 500 federally recognized Indigenous communities and nations–nearly 3 million people in the US." p. 10

### Reservations p. 11
* "In the era of US treaty-making from independence to 1871, the concept of the reservation was one of the Indigenous nation **reserving a narrowed land base from a much larger one in exchange** for US government protection from settlers and the provision of social services.
* "In the late nineteenth century, as Indigenous resistance was weakened, the concept of the reservation changed to one of land being carved out of the public domain of the United States as a benevolent gesture, a 'gift' to the Indigenous peoples. 
* Rhetoric changed so that reservations were said to have been 'given' or 'created' for Indians. With this shift, Indian reservations came to be seen as enclaves within state boundaries. Despite the political and economic reality, **the impression to many was that Indigenous people were taking a free ride on public domain**."

### Macro US Narrative from 1776 - present p.12-13
* "According to the origin narrative, the United States was born of rebellion against oppression–against empire–and thus is the product of the first anticolonial revolution for national liberation. The narrative flows from that fallacy: the broadening and deepening of democracy; the Civil War and the ensuing 'second revolution', which ended slavery; the twentieth-century mission to save Europe from itself-twice; and the ultimately triumphant fight against the scourge of communism, with the United States inheriting the difficult and burdensome task of keeping order in the world. It's a narrative of progress. p. 12
* "The 1960s social revolutions, ignited by the African American liberation movement, complicated the origin narrative, but its structure and periodization have been left intact. After the 1960s, historians incorporated women, African Americans, and immigrants as contributors to the commonweal. 
* "Indeed, the revised narrative produced the 'nation of immigrants' framework, which obscures the US practice of colonization, merging settler colonialism with immigration to metropolitan centers during and after the industrial revolution. 
* "Native peoples, to the extent that they were included at all, were renamed 'First Americans' and thus themselves cast as distant immigrants.
* "The provincialism and national chauvinism of US history production make it difficult for effective revisions to gain authority. Scholars, both Indigenous and a few non-Indigenous, who attempt to rectify the distortions, are labeled advocates, and their findings are rejected for publication on that basis. 
* Indigenous scholars look to research and thinking that has emerged in the rest of the European-colonized world. To understand the historical and current experiences of Indigenous peoples in the United States, these thinkers and writers draw upon and creatively apply the historical materialism of Marxism, the liberation theology of Latin America, Frantz Fanon's psychosocial analyses of the effects of colonialism on the colonizer and the colonized, and other approaches, including development theory and postmodern theory.
* "While not abandoning insights gained from those sources, due to the 'exceptional' nature of US colonialism among nineteenth-century colonial powers, Indigenous scholars and activists are engaged in exploring new approaches." p. 13

### Summary p. 13-14
* "Such histories have been written, and are being written by historians of Diné, Lakota, Mohawk, Tlingit, Muskogee, Anishinaabe, Lumbee, Inuit, Kiowa, Cherokee, Hopi, and other Indigenous communities and nations that have survived colonial genocide.
* "Indigenous peoples, now in a colonial relationship with the United States, inhabited and thrived for millennia before they were displaced to fragmented reservations and economically decimated.
* "This book attempts to tell the story of the United States as a colonialist settler-state, one that, like colonialist European states, crushed and subjugated the original civilizations in the territories it now rules. This is the history of the United States." p. 14

## Chapter 2: Follow the Corn p. 15

### Pre-Agricultural Milestones
* [Pre-Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_expansions_of_hominins_out_of_Africa#Early_dispersals)
	* Gracile australopithecines evolved in East Africa around 4m years ago.
	* Earliest evidence of hominids outside of Africa 2mya
	*  Humanoids "living in small communal groups" eventually populated all continents except for Antartica.
* [Modern Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans)
	* Out of Africa (OOA) aka Recent Single-Origin Hypothesis (RSOH)
	* H. sapiens evolved in the Horn of Africa 200k-300k years ago
	* 220,000 years ago, some migration as far as Greece
	* 120,000 ya, migrations as far as [Maghreb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb) and the Arabian Peninsula
	* This wave of migration seems to have died out about 80,000 ya
	* Most significant "recent wave" out of Africa was 50-70,000 ya via the [Sourthern Route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Dispersal) 

### Americas
* Domestication of plants happened around 11,000 years ago (8,500 BC) in seven regions around the world.
* Three of these areas of first agriculture were located in the Americas: (1) The Valley of Mexico and Central America; (2) South-Central Andes in South America; and (3) eastern North America
* In contrast to animal domestication in Eurasia / Africa, Native American societies focused on game management.

### The Sacred Corn Food p. 16
* Evidence of cultivated corn date back 10,000 years (~8000 BC).
* By 6800 - 6500 BC, "evidence of corn production had spread all the way from the southern tip of South America to the subartic of North America, and from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean."
* "Since there is no evidence of corn on any other continent prior to its post-Columbus dispersal, its development is a unique invention of the original American agriculturalists. Unlike most grains, corn cannot grow wild and cannot exist without attentive human care."
* This also meant that there were centuries of cultural and commercial interchange among the peoples of the Americas; "traders carried seeds as well as other goods and cultural practices."
* Because corn can only live without water for 30 days at most, many more arid regions "required the design and construction of irrigation systems". These systems were built as early as 800 - 500 BC.
* Combination of corn, squash, and beans provide complete protein. p. 17
* By 1490s, 100 million people lived in the Americas, 40m in North America (ex-Central America). Central Mexico alone supported ~30m people, at a time when the population of Europe was 50m (all land west of the Urals).

### Disease-Free and Well-Fed p. 17
* Relatively disease free
* Herbal medicine, surgery, dentistry
* Perhaps most important was hygenic and ritual bathing on a regular basis
* "The majority of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas had healthy, mostly vegetarian diets based on the staple of corn and supplemented by wild fish, fowl, and four-legged animals. 
* "People lived long and well with abundant ceremonial and recreational periods."

### Up From Mexico / Story of Mesoamerica / Mayans / Olmecs p. 17
* Brief overview of "peoples' history of the Valley of Mexico and Central America, often called [Mesoamerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica)." p. 18
	* [Major Eras of Mesoamerican History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_chronology#Chronology)
	* **Before 3500 BC** Paleo-Indian Period
	* **3500-2000 BC** Archaic Period
	* **2000 BC - 250 CE** Preclassical aka Formative Era
	* **250 - 900 CE** Classical Period
	* **900 - 1521 CE** Postclassical Period
	* Post-conquest Era
		* **1521 - 1821** Colonial Period
		* **1821 - present** Postcolonial Period
	* **Mayan civilization** occuped most of Mesoamerica, including all of the Yucatán Peninsula.
		* 2M people lived in [the Mayan Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Maya_civilization) during the five centuries of its pinnacle which occurred during the Classic Period, 250 - 900 CE. 
		* "Mayan culture astonishes all who study it, and it is often compared to Greek (Athenian) culture. At its core was the cultivation of corn; religion was constructed around this vital food." p. 18
		* "By 36 BC, [Mayans had] invented the concept of zero" and had other highly advanced developments in math and astronomy.
	* **Olmec civilization** was to the west, building the great city of Teotihuacán. [Origins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan#History) were in the first century CE and reached its peak between 350-450 AD. The impressiveness and population of this city would not be rivalled anywhere in the Americas until the peak of Aztec civilization almost 1000 years later.
	* "Beginning in AD 750, **Toltec civilization** dominated the region for four centuries, absorbing the Olmecs. Colossal buildings, sculptures, and markets made up the Toltec cities, which housed extensive libraries and universities. They created multiple cities, the largest being Tula. The Toltecs' written language was based on the Mayan form, as was the calendar they used in scientific research, particularly in astronomy and medicine." p. 19
	* "In 1426, the **Aztecs of Tenochtitlán** formed an alliance with the** Texcoco** and **Tlacopan** peoples and **overthrew Tepanec rule**. The allies proceeded to wage war against neighboring peoples and eventually succeeded in gaining control over the Valley of Mexico. The Aztecs emerged as dominant in the Triple Alliance and moved to bring all the peoples of Mexico under their tributary authority." p. 19-20

### Extensive trade networks p. 20
* The powerful Aztec state included "...elaborate markets in each city and a far-flung trade network that used routes established by the Toltecs."
* "Aztec merchants acquired turquoise from Pueblos who mined it in what is now the US Southwest to sell in central Mexico where it had become the most valued of all material possessions and was used as a means of exchange or a form of money. Sixty-five thousand turquoise artifacts in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, are evidence of the importance of turquoise as a major precolonial commodity. Other items were also valuable marketable commodities in the area, salt being close to turquoise in value. Ceramic trade goods involved interconnected markets from Mexico City to Mesa Verde, Colorado. Shells from the Gulf of California, tropical bird feathers from the Gulf Coast area of Mexico, obsidian from Durango, Mexico, and flint from Texas were all found in the ruins of Casa Grande (Arizona), the commercial center of the northern frontier. Turquoise functioning as money was traded to acquire macaw and parrot feathers from tropical areas for religious rituals, seashells from coastal peoples, and hides and meat from the northern plains. The stone has been found in precolonial sites in Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska, where the Wichitas served as intermediaries, carrying turquoise and other goods farther east and north." p. 20


## Chapter 2: Culture of Conquest p. 32
* "...the culture of conquest didn't start with Europeans crossing the Atlantic. European institutions and the worldview of conquest and colonialism had formed several centuries before that. From the eleventh through the thirteenth centuries, Europeans conducted the Crusades to conquer North Africa and the Middle East, leading to unprecedented wealth in the hands of a few. This profit-based religion was the deadly element that European merchants and settlers brought to the Americas."
