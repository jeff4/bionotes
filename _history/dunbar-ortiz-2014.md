## Introduction: This Land p. 1
* David Chang: 'Nation, race, and class converged in land.' p. 1
* Patrick Wolfe: 'The question of genocide is  never far from discussion of settler colonialism. Land is life–or, at least, land is necessary for life.' p. 2
* "The history of the United States is a history of settler colonialism–the founding of a state based on the ideology of white supremacy, the widespread practice of African slavery, and a policy of genocide and land theft."
* "Traditionally, historians of the US hoping to have successful careers in academia and to author lucrative textbooks become protectors of this [*Columbian* - poetic Latinate name of the 19th century origin myth from the founding onward] origin myth. With the upheavals in the academic world during the 1960s, engendered by the civil rights movement and student activism, historians came to call for objectivity and fairness in revising interpretations of US history.
* "The warned against moralizing, urging instead a dispassionate and culturally relative approach. 
* Historian Bernard Sheehan, in an influential essay, called for a 'cultural conflict' understanding of Native-Euro-American relations in the early United States, writing that this approach 'diffuses the locus of guilt'. In striving for 'balance', however, historians spouted platitudes: 'There were good and bad people on both sides'. 'American culture is an amalgamation of all its ethnic groups'. 'A frontier is a zone of interaction between cultures, not merely advancing European settlements.'" p. 4
* "Later, trendy postmodernist studies insisted on Indigenous 'agency' under the guise of individual and collective empowerment, making the casualties of colonialism responsible for their own demise. Perhaps worst of all, some claimed (and still claim) that the colonizer and colonized experienced an 'encounter' and engaged in 'dialogue', thereby masking reality with justifications and rationalizations–in short, apologies for one-sided robbery and murder. In focusing on 'cultural change' and 'conflict between cultures', these studies avoid fundamental questions about the formation of the United States and its implications for the present and future. This approach to history allows one to safely put aside present responsibility for continued harm done by that past and the questions of reparations, restitution, and reordering society.
* "Multiculturalism became the cutting edge of post-civil-rights movement US history revisionism. For this scheme to work–and affirm US historical progress–Indigenous nations and communities had to be left out of the picture. As territorially and treaty-based peoples in North America, they did not fit the grid of multiculturalism but were included by transforming them into an inchoate oppressed racial group, while colonized Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans were dissolved into another such group, variously called "Hispanic" or "Latino." The multicultural approach emphasized the 'contributions' of individuals from oppressed groups to the country's assumed greatness. Indigenous peoples were thus credited with corn, beans, buckskin, log cabins, parkas, maple syrup, canoes, hundreds of place names, Thanksgiving, and even the concepts of democracy and federalism. But this idea of the gift-giving Indian helping to establish and enrich the development of the United States **is an insidious smoke screen meant to obscure the fact that the very existence of the country is a result of the looting of an entire continent and its resources**. The fundamental unresolved issues of Indigenous lands, treaties, and sovereignty could not but scuttle the premises of multiculturalism." p. 5
* "With multiculturalism, manifest destiny won the day. As an example, in 1994, Prentice Hall (part of Pearson Education) published a new college-level US history textbook, authored by four members of a new generation of revisionist historians. These radical social historians are all brilliant scholars with posts in prestigious universities. The book's title reflects the intent of its authors and publisher: *Out of Many: A History of the American People*. The origin story of a supposedly unitary nation, albeit now multicultural, remained intact. The original cover design featured a multicolored woven fabric–this image meant to stand in place of the discredited 'melting pot'.
* "With a traditional Navajo dwelling, a hogan, in the background, the woman was shown kneeling in front of a traditional loom, weaving a nearly finished rug. The design? The Stars and Stripes! The authors, upon hearing my objection and explanation that Navajo weavers make their livings off commissioned work that includes the desired design, responded: 'But it's a real photograph'. To the authors' credit, in the second edition they replaced the cover photograph and removed the Navajo picture inside, although the narrative text remains unchanged. 
* "Awareness of the settler-colonialist context of US history writing is essential...The form of colonialism that the Indigenous peoples of North America have experienced was modern from the beginning: the expansion of European corporations, backed by government armies, into foreign areas, with subsequent expropriation of lands and resources. Settler colonialism is a genocidal policy. Native nations and communities, while struggling to maintain fundamental values and collectivity, have from the beginning resisted modern colonialism using both defensive and offensive techniques, including the modern forms of armed resistance of national liberation movements and what now is called terrorism.
* "In every instance, Native nations have fought for survival as peoples. The objective of US colonialist authorities was to terminate their existence as peoples–not as random individuals. This is the very definition of modern genocide as contrasted with premodern instances of extreme violence that did not have the goal of extinction. The United States as a socioeconomic and political entity is a result of this centuries-long and ongoing colonial process. Modern Indigenous nations and communities are societies formed by their resistance to colonialism...It is breathtaking, but no miracle, that they have survived as peoples." p. 6-7
* "To say that the United States is a colonialist settler-state is not to make an accusation but rather to face historical reality, without which consideration not much in US history makes sense, unless Indigenous peoples are erased. **But Indigenous nations, through resistance, have survived and bear witness to this history.**"

### Neocolonialism p. 7
* During the second half of the 20th century, "the former colonial powers and their intellectual apologists mounted a counterforce, often called *neocolonialism*, from which multiculturalism and postmodernism emerged."
	* "Although much revisionist US history reflects neocolonialist strategy–**an attempt to accommodate new realities in order to retain the dominance**–neocolonialist methods signal victory for the colonized.
	* "Such approaches pry off a lid long kept tightly fastened.
	* "One result has been the presence of significant numbers of Indigenous scholars in US universities who are changing the terms of analysis. 
	* "The main challenge for scholars in revising US history in the context of colonialism is not lack of information, nor is it one of methodology. **Rather, the source of the problems has been the refusal or inability of US historians to comprehend the nature of their own history, US history. The fundamental problem is the absence of the colonial framework.**" p. 7

### Settler Colonialism p. 7-8
	
* "Through economic penetration of Indigenous societies, the European and Euro-American colonial powers created economic dependency and imbalance of trade, then incorporated the Indigenous nations into spheres of influence and **controlled them indirectly or as protectorates, with indispensable use of Christian missionaries and alcohol**. In the case of US settler colonialism, **land was the primary commodity**. With such obvious indicators of colonialism at work, why should so many interpretations of US political-economic development be convoluted and obscure, avoiding the obvious? p. 7
* "...the twentieth-century emergence of the field of 'US West' or 'Borderlands' history has been forced into an incomplete and flawed settler-colonialist framework. The father of that field of history, Frederick Jackson Turner, confessed as much in 1901: 'Our colonial system did not start with the Spanish War [1898]; the U.S. had had a colonial history and policy from the beginning of the Republic; but they have been hidden under the phraseology of *interstate migration* and *territorial organization*.'" p. 7-8
* "The **notion that settler-indigenous conflict is an inevitable product of cultural differences and misunderstandings**, or that violence was committed equally by the colonized and the colonizer, **blurs the nature of the historical processes**. 

### Genocidal policies p. 8-10

* "Euro-American colonialism, an aspect of the capitalist economic globalization, had from its beginnings a genocidal tendency...US history, as well as inherited Indigenous trauma, cannot be understood without dealing with the genocide that the United States committed against Indigenous peoples...The absence of even the slightest note of regret or tragedy in the annual celebration of the US independence betrays a deep disconnect in the consciousness of US Americans." p. 8-9
* "Ojibwe historian Jean O'Brien names the practice of writing Indians out of existence 'firsting and lasting'.
	* "All over the continent, local histories, monuments, and signage narrate the story of first settlement: the founder(s), the first school, first dwelling, first everything, as if there had never been occupants who thrived in those places before Euro-Americans. On the other hand, the national narrative tells of 'last' Indians or last tribes, such as 'the last of the Mohicans', 'Ishi, the last Indian', and *End of the Trail*, as a famous sculpture by James Earle Fraser is titled."
* Four distinct periods of offical genocidal policies by US administrations
	1. Jacksonian period of forced removal (1830s)
	2. California Gold Rush in Northern California (1849-1850s)
	3. post-Civil War era of the so-called Indian wars in the Great Plains (1850s-1870s)
	4. 1950s termination period
* 1873 quote from General William Sherman: 'We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children...during an assault, the soldiers can not pause to distinguish between male and female, or even discriminate as to age.' p. 9-10
* Patrick Wolfe: 'the peculiarity of settler colonialism is that the goal is elimination of Indigenous populations in order to make land available to settlers. That project is not limited to government policy, but rather involves all kinds of agencies, voluntary militias, and the settlers themselves acting on their own.' p. 10
* "There are more than 500 federally recognized Indigenous communities and nations–nearly 3 million people in the US." p. 10

### Reservations p. 11
* "In the era of US treaty-making from independence to 1871, the concept of the reservation was one of the Indigenous nation **reserving a narrowed land base from a much larger one in exchange** for US government protection from settlers and the provision of social services.
* "In the late nineteenth century, as Indigenous resistance was weakened, the concept of the reservation changed to one of land being carved out of the public domain of the United States as a benevolent gesture, a 'gift' to the Indigenous peoples. 
* Rhetoric changed so that reservations were said to have been 'given' or 'created' for Indians. With this shift, Indian reservations came to be seen as enclaves within state boundaries. Despite the political and economic reality, **the impression to many was that Indigenous people were taking a free ride on public domain**."

### Macro US Narrative from 1776 - present p.12-13
* "According to the origin narrative, the United States was born of rebellion against oppression–against empire–and thus is the product of the first anticolonial revolution for national liberation. The narrative flows from that fallacy: the broadening and deepening of democracy; the Civil War and the ensuing 'second revolution', which ended slavery; the twentieth-century mission to save Europe from itself-twice; and the ultimately triumphant fight against the scourge of communism, with the United States inheriting the difficult and burdensome task of keeping order in the world. It's a narrative of progress. p. 12
* "The 1960s social revolutions, ignited by the African American liberation movement, complicated the origin narrative, but its structure and periodization have been left intact. After the 1960s, historians incorporated women, African Americans, and immigrants as contributors to the commonweal. 
* "Indeed, the revised narrative produced the 'nation of immigrants' framework, which obscures the US practice of colonization, merging settler colonialism with immigration to metropolitan centers during and after the industrial revolution. 
* "**Native peoples, to the extent that they were included at all, were renamed 'First Americans' and thus themselves cast as distant immigrants.**
* "The provincialism and national chauvinism of US history production make it difficult for effective revisions to gain authority. Scholars, both Indigenous and a few non-Indigenous, who attempt to rectify the distortions, are labeled advocates, and their findings are rejected for publication on that basis. 
* Indigenous scholars look to research and thinking that has emerged in the rest of the European-colonized world. To understand the historical and current experiences of Indigenous peoples in the United States, these thinkers and writers draw upon and creatively apply the historical materialism of Marxism, the liberation theology of Latin America, Frantz Fanon's psychosocial analyses of the effects of colonialism on the colonizer and the colonized, and other approaches, including development theory and postmodern theory.
* "While not abandoning insights gained from those sources, due to the 'exceptional' nature of US colonialism among nineteenth-century colonial powers, Indigenous scholars and activists are engaged in exploring new approaches." p. 13

### Summary p. 13-14
* "Such histories have been written, and are being written by historians of Diné, Lakota, Mohawk, Tlingit, Muskogee, Anishinaabe, Lumbee, Inuit, Kiowa, Cherokee, Hopi, and other Indigenous communities and nations that have survived colonial genocide.
* "Indigenous peoples, now in a colonial relationship with the United States, inhabited and thrived for millennia before they were displaced to fragmented reservations and economically decimated.
* "This book attempts to tell the story of the United States as a colonialist settler-state, one that, like colonialist European states, crushed and subjugated the original civilizations in the territories it now rules. This is the history of the United States." p. 14

## Chapter 2: Follow the Corn p. 15

### Pre-Agricultural Milestones
* [Pre-Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_expansions_of_hominins_out_of_Africa#Early_dispersals)
	* Gracile australopithecines evolved in East Africa around 4m years ago.
	* Earliest evidence of hominids outside of Africa 2mya
	*  Humanoids "living in small communal groups" eventually populated all continents except for Antartica.
* [Modern Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans)
	* Out of Africa (OOA) aka Recent Single-Origin Hypothesis (RSOH)
	* H. sapiens evolved in the Horn of Africa 200k-300k years ago
	* 220,000 years ago, some migration as far as Greece
	* 120,000 ya, migrations as far as [Maghreb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb) and the Arabian Peninsula
	* This wave of migration seems to have died out about 80,000 ya
	* Most significant "recent wave" out of Africa was 50-70,000 ya via the [Sourthern Route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Dispersal) 

### Americas
* Domestication of plants happened around 11,000 years ago (8,500 BC) in seven regions around the world.
* Three of these areas of first agriculture were located in the Americas: (1) The Valley of Mexico and Central America; (2) South-Central Andes in South America; and (3) eastern North America
* In contrast to animal domestication in Eurasia / Africa, Native American societies focused on game management.

### The Sacred Corn Food p. 16
* Evidence of cultivated corn date back 10,000 years (~8000 BC).
* By 6800 - 6500 BC, "evidence of corn production had spread all the way from the southern tip of South America to the subartic of North America, and from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean."
* "Since there is no evidence of corn on any other continent prior to its post-Columbus dispersal, its development is a unique invention of the original American agriculturalists. Unlike most grains, corn cannot grow wild and cannot exist without attentive human care."
* This also meant that there were centuries of cultural and commercial interchange among the peoples of the Americas; "traders carried seeds as well as other goods and cultural practices."
* Because corn can only live without water for 30 days at most, the more arid regions--of which there were many--"required the design and construction of irrigation systems". These systems were built as early as 800 - 500 BC.
* Combination of corn, squash, and beans provide complete protein. p. 17
* By 1490s, 100 million people lived in the Americas, 40m in North America (ex-Central America). Central Mexico alone supported ~30m people, at a time when the population of Europe was 50m (all land west of the Urals).

### Disease-Free and Well-Fed p. 17
* Relatively disease free
* Herbal medicine, surgery, dentistry
* Perhaps most important was hygenic and ritual bathing on a regular basis
* "The majority of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas had healthy, mostly vegetarian diets based on the staple of corn and supplemented by wild fish, fowl, and four-legged animals. 
* "People lived long and well with abundant ceremonial and recreational periods."

### Up From Mexico / Story of Mesoamerica / Mayans / Olmecs p. 17
* Brief overview of "peoples' history of the Valley of Mexico and Central America, often called [Mesoamerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica)." p. 18
	* [Major Eras of Mesoamerican History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_chronology#Chronology)
	* **Before 3500 BC** Paleo-Indian Period
	* **3500-2000 BC** Archaic Period
	* **2000 BC - 250 CE** Preclassical aka Formative Era
	* **250 - 900 CE** Classical Period
	* **900 - 1521 CE** Postclassical Period
	* Post-conquest Era
		* **1521 - 1821** Colonial Period
		* **1821 - present** Postcolonial Period
	* **Mayan civilization** occuped most of Mesoamerica, including all of the Yucatán Peninsula.
		* 2M people lived in [the Mayan Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Maya_civilization) during the five centuries of its pinnacle which occurred during the Classic Period, 250 - 900 CE. 
		* "Mayan culture astonishes all who study it, and it is often compared to Greek (Athenian) culture. At its core was the cultivation of corn; religion was constructed around this vital food." p. 18
		* "By 36 BC, [Mayans had] invented the concept of zero" and had other highly advanced developments in math and astronomy.
	* **Olmec civilization** was to the west, building the great city of Teotihuacán. [Origins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan#History) were in the first century CE and reached its peak between 350-450 AD. The impressiveness and population of this city would not be rivalled anywhere in the Americas until the peak of Aztec civilization almost 1000 years later.
	* "Beginning in AD 750, **Toltec civilization** dominated the region for four centuries, absorbing the Olmecs. Colossal buildings, sculptures, and markets made up the Toltec cities, which housed extensive libraries and universities. They created multiple cities, the largest being Tula. The Toltecs' written language was based on the Mayan form, as was the calendar they used in scientific research, particularly in astronomy and medicine." p. 19
	* "In 1426, the **Aztecs of Tenochtitlán** formed an alliance with the** Texcoco** and **Tlacopan** peoples and **overthrew Tepanec rule**. The allies proceeded to wage war against neighboring peoples and eventually succeeded in gaining control over the Valley of Mexico. The Aztecs emerged as dominant in the Triple Alliance and moved to bring all the peoples of Mexico under their tributary authority." p. 19-20

### Extensive trade networks p. 20
* The powerful Aztec state included "...elaborate markets in each city and a far-flung trade network that used routes established by the Toltecs."
* "Aztec merchants acquired turquoise from Pueblos who mined it in what is now the US Southwest to sell in central Mexico where it had become the most valued of all material possessions and was used as a means of exchange or a form of money. Sixty-five thousand turquoise artifacts in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, are evidence of the importance of turquoise as a major precolonial commodity. Other items were also valuable marketable commodities in the area, salt being close to turquoise in value. Ceramic trade goods involved interconnected markets from Mexico City to Mesa Verde, Colorado. Shells from the Gulf of California, tropical bird feathers from the Gulf Coast area of Mexico, obsidian from Durango, Mexico, and flint from Texas were all found in the ruins of Casa Grande (Arizona), the commercial center of the northern frontier. Turquoise functioning as money was traded to acquire macaw and parrot feathers from tropical areas for religious rituals, seashells from coastal peoples, and hides and meat from the northern plains. The stone has been found in precolonial sites in Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska, where the Wichitas served as intermediaries, carrying turquoise and other goods farther east and north." p. 20


## Chapter 2: Culture of Conquest p. 32
* "...the culture of conquest didn't start with Europeans crossing the Atlantic. European institutions and the worldview of conquest and colonialism had formed several centuries before that. From the eleventh through the thirteenth centuries, Europeans conducted the Crusades to conquer North Africa and the Middle East, leading to unprecedented wealth in the hands of a few. This profit-based religion was the deadly element that European merchants and settlers brought to the Americas."
* "In addition to seeking personal wealth, colonizers expressed a Christian zeal that justified colonialism. Along with that came the militaristic tradition that had also developed in western Europe during the Crusades (literally, 'carrying of the cross'). Although the popes, beginning with Urban II, called for most of the ventures, the crusading armies were mercenary outfits that promised the soldiers the right to sack and loot Muslim towns and cities, feats that would gain them wealth and prestige back home.
* "Toward the end of the thirteenth century, the papacy began directing such mercenaries to crush domestic "enemies" in their midst, as well-pagans and commoners in general, especially women (as ostensible witches) and heretics. In this way, knights and noblemen could seize land and force the commoners living on it into servitude. 
* "Historian Peter Linebaugh notes that whereas the anti-Muslim Crusades were attempts to control the lucrative Muslim trade routes to the Far East, the domestic crusades against heretics and commoners were carried out to terrorize poor people and at the same time to enlist them in the lucrative and adventurous yet holy venture: 'Crusading was thus a murderous device to resolve a contradiction by bringing baron and commoner together in the cauldron of religious war'.
* "The first population forcibly organized under the profit motive-­whose labor was exploited well before overseas exploitation was possible--was the European peasantry. Once forced off their land, they had nothing to eat and nothing to sell but their labor. In addition, entire nations, such as Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Bohemia, the Basque Country, and Catalonia, were colonized and forced under the rule of various monarchies. The Moorish Nation and the Sephardic Jewish minority were conquered and physically deported by the Castilian/Aragon monarchy from the Iberian Peninsula--a long-term project culminating in group expulsions beginning in 1492, the year Columbus sailed to America. The institutions of colonialism and methods for relocation, deportation, and expropriation of land had already been practiced, if not perfected, by the end of the fifteenth century. 
* "**The rise of the modern state in western Europe was based on the accumulation of wealth by means of exploiting human labor and displacing millions of subsistence producers from their lands.** The armies that did this work benefited from technological innovations that allowed the development of more effective weapons of death and destruction. When these states expanded overseas to obtain even more resources, land, and labor, they were not starting anew. The peoples of the Caribbean, Central America, Mexico, and the Andes were the first overseas victims. West and South Africa, North America, and the rest of South America followed. Then came all of Africa, the Pacific, and Asia.
* "The sea voyages of European explorers and merchants in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries were not the first of their kind. These voyagers borrowed the techniques for long-distance sea travel from the Arab world. Before the Arabs ventured into the Indian Ocean, Inuits (Eskimos) plied the Arctic Circle in their kayaks for centuries and made contacts with many peoples, as did Norse, South Asian, Chinese, Japanese, Peruvian, and Melanesian and Polynesian fishing peoples of the Pacific. Egyptian and Greek knowledge of the seas most likely extended beyond the Mediterranean, into the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Western European seagoing merchants and the monarchies that backed them would differ only in that they had developed the bases for colonial domination and exploitation of labor in those colonies that led to the capture and enslavement of millions of Africans to transport to their American colonies." p.34

### Land as Private Property p. 34

* "Along with the cargo of European ships, especially of the later British colonizing ventures, came the emerging concept of land as private property. Esther Kingston-Mann, a specialist in Russian land tenure history, has reconstructed the elevation of land as private property to "sacred status" in sixteenth-century England. The English used the term "enclosure" to denote the privatization of the commons. During this time, peasants, who constituted a large majority of the population, were evicted from their ancient common lands. For centuries the commons had been their pasture for milk cows and for running sheep and their source for water, wood for fuel and construction, and edible and medicinal wild plants. 
* "Without these resources they could not have survived as farmers, and they did not survive as farmers after they lost access to the commons. Not only were the commons privatized during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, they were also transformed into grazing lands for commercial sheep production, wool being the main domestic and export commodity, creating wealth for a few and impoverishment for the many. Denied access to the former commons, rural subsistence farmers and even their children had no choice but to work in the new woolen textile factories under miserable conditions--that is, when they could find such work because unemployment was high. Employed or not, this displaced population was available to serve as settlers in the North American British colonies, many of them as indentured servants, with the promise of land. After serving their terms of indenture, they were free to squat on Indigenous land and become farmers again. In this way, surplus labor created not only low labor costs and great profits for the woolens manufacturers but also a supply of settlers for the colonies, which was an 'escape valve' in the home country, where impoverishment could lead to uprisings of the exploited. The sacred status of property in the forms of land taken from Indigenous farmers and of Africans as chattel was seeded into the drive for Anglo-American independence from Britain and the founding of the United States.
* "Privatization of land was accompanied by an ideological drive to paint the commoners who resisted as violent, stupid, and lazy. The English Parliament, under the guise of fighting backwardness, criminalized former rights to the commons. Accompanying and facilitating the privatization of the commons was the suppression of women, as feminist theorist Silvia Federici has argued, by conjuring witchcraft. Those accused of witchcraft were poor peasant women, often widows, while the accusers tended to be wealthier, either their landlords or employers, individuals who controlled local institutions or had ties to the national government. Neighbors were encouraged to accuse one another. Witchcraft was considered mainly a female crime, especially at the peak of the witch hunts between 1550 and 1650, when more than 80 percent of those who were charged with witchcraft, tried, convicted, and executed were women. In England, those accused of witchcraft were mostly elderly women, often beggars, sometimes the wives of living laborers but usually widows." p.35
* "Actions and local occurrences said to indicate witchcraft included nonpayment of rent, demand for public assistance, giving the "evil­eye," local die-offs of horses or other stock, and mysterious deaths of children. Also among the telltale actions were practices related to midwifery and any kind of contraception. **The service that women provided among the poor as healers was one of a number of vestiges from pre-Christian, matrilineal institutions that once predominated in Europe. It is no surprise that those who had held on to and perpetuated these communal practices were those most resistant to the enclosure of the commons, the economic base of the peasantry, as well as women's autonomy.**
* "The traumatized souls thrown off the land, as well as their descendants, became the land-hungry settlers enticed to cross a vast ocean with the promise of land and attaining the status of gentry. English settlers brought witch-hunting with them to Jamestown, Virginia, and to Salem, Massachusetts. In language reminiscent of that used to condemn witches, they quickly identified the Indigenous populations as inherently children of Satan and 'servants of the devil' who deserved to be killed. Later the Salem authorities would justify witch trials by claiming that the English settlers were inhabiting land controlled by the devil." p. 36

### White Supremacy and Class p. 36

* "Also part of the Christian colonizers' outlook was a belief in white supremacy. As an 1878 US Protestant evangelical hymn suggests--'Are your garments spotless? / Are they white as snow? / Are they washed in the blood of the lamb?'--whiteness as an ideology involves much more than skin color, although skin color has been and continues to be a key component of racism in the United States. White supremacy can be traced to the colonizing ventures of the Christian Crusades in Muslim-controlled territories and to the Protestant colonization of Ireland. As dress rehearsals for the coloniza­ tion of the Americas, these projects form the two strands that merge in the geopolitical and sociocultural makeup of US society.

#### Pure Blood, Jews, Moors, and the Spanish Inquisition

* "The Crusades in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal today) and expulsion of Jews and Muslims were part of a process that created the core ideology for modern colonialism--white supremacy--and its justification for genocide. The Crusades gave birth to the papal law of *limpieza de sangre*-cleanliness of blood-for which the Inquisition was established by the Church to investigate and determine. **Before this time the concept of biological race based on "blood" is not known to have existed as law or taboo in Christian Europe or anywhere else in the world.** As scapegoating and suspicion of *conversos* (Jews who had converted to Christianity) and *moriscos* (Muslims who had converted to Christianity) intensified over several centuries in Christian-controlled Spain, the doctrine of *limpieza de sangre* was popularized. 
* "It had the effect of granting psychological and increasingly legal privileges to 'Old Christians', both rich and poor, thus obscuring the class differences between the landed aristocracy and land-poor peasants and shepherds. Whatever their economic station, the 'Old Christian' Spanish were enabled to identify with the nobility. As one Spanish historian puts it, "The common people looked upwards, wishing and hoping to climb, and let themselves be seduced by chivalric ideals: honour, dignity, glory, and the noble life." 
* "Lope de Vega, a sixteenth-century contemporary of Cervantes, wrote: 'Soy un hombre, I aunque de villana casta, I limpio de sangre y jamas I de hebrea o mora manchada' (I am a man, although of lowly status, yet clean of blood and with no mixture of Jewish or Moorish blood).

#### Race and England

* "This cross-class mind-set can be found as well in the stance of descendants of the old settlers of British colonization in North America. This then is the first instance of class leveling based on imagined racial sameness-the origin of white supremacy, the essential ideology of colonial projects in America and Africa. **As Elie Wiesel famously observed, the road to Auschwitz was paved in the earliest days of Christendom.** Historian David Stannard, in *American Holocaust*, adds the caveat that the same road led straight through the heart of America. The ideology of white supremacy was paramount in neutralizing the class antagonisms of the landless against the landed and distributing confiscated lands and properties of Moors and Jews in Iberia, of the Irish in Ulster, and of Native American and African peoples.
* "Great Britain, emerging as an overseas colonial power a century after Spain did, absorbed aspects of the Spanish racial caste system into its colonialist rationalizations, particularly regarding African slavery, but it did so within the context of Protestantism, which imagined a chosen people founding and raising a New Jerusalem. The English did not just adapt the habits and experiences of Spanish colonization; they had their own prior experience, which actually constituted overseas imperialism. During the early seventeenth century the English conquered Ireland and declared a half-million acres of land in the north open to settlement. The settlers who served early settler colonialism came mostly from western Scotland. England had previously conquered Wales and Scotland, but it had never before attempted to remove so large an Indigenous population and plant settlers in their place as in Ireland. The ancient Irish social system was systematically attacked, traditional songs and music forbidden, whole clans exterminated, and the remainder brutalized. A 'wild Irish' reservation was even attempted. The 'plantation' of Ulster was as much a culmination of, as it was a departure from, centuries of intermittent warfare in Ireland. 
* "In the sixteenth century, the official in charge of the Irish province of Munster, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, ordered that:
	the heddes of all those (of what sort soever thei were) which were killed in the daie, should be cutte off from their bodies and brought to the place where he [Gilbert] incamped at night, and should there bee laied on the ground by eche side of the waie ledying into his owne tente so that none could come into his tente for any cause but commonly he muste passe through a lane of heddes which he used ad terrorem... [It brought] greate terrour to the people when thei sawe the heddes of their dedde fathers, brothers, children, kindsfolke, and friends... [It brought] greate terrour to the people when thei sawe the heddes of their dedde fathers, brothers, children, kindsfolke, and friends.
* "The English government paid bounties for the Irish heads. Later only the scalp or ears were required. A century later in North America, Indian heads and scalps were brought in for bounty in the same manner. Although the Irish were as 'white' as the English, transforming them into alien others to be exterminated previewed what came to be perceived as racialist when applied to Indigenous peoples of North America and to Africans.
* "At that conjuncture, both in the Christian Crusades against Muslims and England's invasion of Ireland, the transition from religious wars to the genocidal mode of colonialism is apparent. The Irish under British colonial rule, well into the twentieth century, continued to be regarded as biologically inferior. During the mid-nineteenth century, influenced by Social Darwinism, some English scientists peddled the theory that the Irish (and all people of color) had descended from apes, while the English were descendants of "man," who had been created by God "in his own image." Thus the English were "angels" and the Irish (and other colonized peoples) were a lower species, which today US "Christian Identity" white supremacists call "mud people," inferior products of the process of evolution. The same Sir Humphrey Gilbert who had been in charge of the colonization of Ulster planted the first English colonial settlement in North America in Newfoundland in the summer of 1583. In the lead-up to the formation of the United States, Protestantism uniquely refined white supremacy as part of a politico-religious ideology." p.39

### Terminal Narratives p. 39

* "According to the current consensus among historians, the wholesale transfer of land from Indigenous to Euro-American hands that occurred in the Americas after 1492 is due less to European invasion, warfare, and material acquisitiveness than to the bacteria that the invaders unwittingly brought with them. Historian Colin Calloway is among the proponents of this theory, and he writes that 'epidemic diseases would have caused massive depopulation in the Americas whether brought by European invaders or brought home by Native American traders'. 
* "Such an absolutist assertion renders any other fate for the Indigenous peoples improbable. Professor Calloway is a careful and widely respected historian of Indigenous North America, but his conclusion articulates a default assumption. 
* "The thinking behind the assumption is both ahistorical and illogical in that Europe itself lost a third to one-half of its population to infectious disease during medieval pandemics. The principal reason the consensus view is wrong and ahistorical is that it erases the effects of settler colonialism with its antecedents in the Spanish "Reconquest" and the English conquest of Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. 
* "By the time Spain, Portugal, and Britain arrived to colonize the Americas, their methods of eradicating peoples or forcing them into dependency and servitude were ingrained, streamlined, and effective. If disease could have done the job, it is not clear why the European colonizers in America found it necessary to carry out unrelenting wars against Indigenous communities in order to gain every inch of land they took from them--nearly three hundred years of colonial warfare, followed by continued wars waged by the independent republics of the hemisphere."
* "Whatever disagreement may exist about the size of precolonial Indigenous populations, no one doubts that a rapid demographic decline occurred in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, its timing from region to region depending on when conquest and colonization began. Nearly all the population areas of the Americas were reduced by 90 percent following the onset of colonizing projects, decreasing the targeted Indigenous populations of the Americas from one hundred million to ten million. Commonly referred to as the most extreme demographic disaster--framed as natural--in human history, it was rarely called genocide until the rise of Indigenous movements in the mid-twentieth century forged questions.
* "US scholar Benjamin Keen acknowledges that historians 'accept uncritically a fatalistic *epidemic plus lack of acquired immunity* ex­ planation for the shrinkage of Indian populations, without sufficient attention to the socioeconomic factors . . . which predisposed the natives to succumb to even slight infections.' 
* "Other scholars agree. Geographer William M. Denevan, while not ignoring the existence of widespread epidemic diseases, has emphasized the role of warfare, which reinforced the lethal impact of disease. There were military engagements directly between European and Indigenous nations, but many more saw European powers pitting one Indigenous nation against another or factions within nations, with European allies aiding one or both sides, as was the case in the colonization of the peoples of Ireland, Africa, and Asia. 
* "Other killers cited by Denevan are overwork in mines, frequent outright butchery, malnutrition and starvation resulting from the breakdown of Indigenous trade networks, subsistence food production and loss of land, loss of will to live or reproduce (and thus suicide, abortion, and infanticide), and deportation and enslavement. 
* "Anthropologist Henry Dobyns has pointed to the interruption of Indigenous peoples' trade networks. When colonizing powers seized Indigenous trade routes, the ensuing acute shortages, including food products, weakened populations and forced them into dependency on the colonizers, with European manufactured goods replacing Indigenous ones. Dobyns has estimated that all Indigenous groups suffered serious food shortages one year in four. In these circumstances, the introduction and promotion of alcohol proved addictive and deadly, adding to the breakdown of social order and responsibility. These realities render the myth of 'lack of immunity', including to alcohol, pernicious. 
* "Historian Woodrow Wilson Borah focused on the broader arena of European colonization, which also brought depopulation in the Pacific Islands, Australia, western Central America, and West Africa. 
* "Sherburne Cook--associated with Borah in the revisionist Berkeley School, as it was called--studied the attempted destruction of the California Indians. Cook estimated 2,245 deaths among peoples in Northern California--the Wintu, Maidu, Miwak, Omo, Wappo, and Yokuts Nations--in late-eighteenth-century armed conflicts with the Spanish, while some 5,ooo died from disease and another 4,000 were relocated to missions. Among the same people in the second half of the nineteenth century, US armed forces killed 4,000, and disease killed another 6,000. Between 1852 and 1867, US citizens kidnapped 4,000 Indian children from these groups in California. Disruption of Indigenous social structures under these conditions and dire economic necessity forced many of the women into prostitution in goldfield camps, further wrecking what vestiges of family life remained in these matriarchal societies.
* "Proponents of the default position emphasize attrition by disease despite other causes equally deadly, if not more so. In doing so they refuse to accept that the colonization of America was genocidal by plan, not simply the tragic fate of populations lacking immunity to disease. In the case of the Jewish Holocaust, no one denies that more Jews died of starvation, overwork, and disease under Nazi incarceration than died in gas ovens, yet the acts of creating and maintaining the conditions that led to those deaths clearly constitute genocide.
* "Anthropologist Michael V. Wilcox asks, 'What if archaeologists were asked to explain the continued presence of descendant communities five hundred years after Columbus instead of their disappearance or marginality?' Cox calls for the active dismantling of what he terms *terminal narratives*-'accounts of Indian histories which explain the absence, cultural death, or disappearance of Indigenous peoples.'

### Gold Fever p. 42

* "Searching for gold, Columbus reached many of the islands of the Caribbean and mapped them. Soon, a dozen other soldier-merchants mapped the Atlantic coast from the northern Maritimes to the tip of South America. From the Iberian Peninsula came merchants, mercenaries, criminals, and peasants. They seized the land and property of Indigenous populations and declared the territories to be extensions of the Spanish and Portuguese states. These acts were confirmed by the monarchies and endorsed by the papal authority of the Roman Catholic Church. The Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 divided the 'New World' between Spain and Portugal with a line drawn from Greenland south through what is now Brazil. Called the *Doctrine of Discovery*, it claimed that possession of the entire world west of that line would be open to Spanish conquest and all east of it to Portuguese conquest.
* "The story is well known. In 1492, Columbus sailed with three ships on his first voyage at the behest of Ferdinand, King of Aragon, and Isabella, Queen of Castille. The marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1469 had led to the merger of their kingdoms into what would become the core of the Spanish state. Columbus planted a colony of forty of his men on *Espanola* (renamed to the island of Santo Domingo and divided into the Dominican Republic and and Haiti) and returned to Spain with Indigenous slaves and gold. In 1493, Columbus returned to the Caribbean with seventeen ships, more than a thousand men, and supplies. He found that the men he had left on the first trip had subsequently been killed by the Indigenous inhabitants. After planting another settlement, Columbus returned to Spain with four hundred Arawak slaves. With seven ships, Columbus returned to the Caribbean in 1498, reaching what is now Venezuela, and he made a fourth and final voyage in 1502, this time touching the Caribbean coast of Central America. In 1513, Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama and charted the Pacific coast of the Americas. Juan Ponce de León claimed the Florida peninsula for Spain in 1513. In 1521, following a three-year bloodbath and overthrow of the Aztec state, Hernando Cortés proclaimed Mexico as New Spain. 
* "Parallel with the crushing of Mexican resistance were Ferdinand Magellan's explorations and charting of the Atlantic coast of the South American continent, followed by Spanish wars against the Inca Nation of the Andes. In both Mexico and Peru, the conquistadors confiscated elaborate artwork and statuary made of gold and silver to be melted down for use as money. During the same period, the Portuguese laid waste to what is today Brazil and began a thriving slave trade that would funnel millions of enslaved Africans to South America, beginning the lucrative Atlantic slave trade.
