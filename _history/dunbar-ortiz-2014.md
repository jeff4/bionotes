## Introduction: This Land p. 1
* David Chang: 'Nation, race, and class converged in land.' p. 1
* Patrick Wolfe: 'The question of genocide is  never far from discussion of settler colonialism. Land is life–or, at least, land is necessary for life.' p. 2
* "The history of the United States is a history of settler colonialism–the foudning of a state based on the ideology of white supremacy, the widespread practice of African slavery, and a policy of genocide and land theft."
* "Traditionally, historians of the US hoping to have successful careers in academia and to author lucrative textbooks become protectors of this [Columbian - poetic Latinate name of the 19th century origin myth from the founding onward] origin myth. With the upheavals in the academic world during the 1960s, engendered by the civil rights movement and student activism, historians came to call for objectivity and fairness in revising interpretations of US history.
* "The warned against moralizing, urging instead a dispassionate and culturally relative approach. 
* Historian Bernard Sheehan, in an influential essay, called for a 'cultural conflict' understanding of Native-Euro-American relations in the early United States, writing that this approach 'diffuses the locus of guilt'. In striving for 'balance', however, historians spouted platitudes: 'There were good and bad people on both sides'. 'American culture is an amalgama­tion of all its ethnic groups'. 'A frontier is a zone of interaction between cultures, not merely advancing European settlements.'" p. 4
* "Later, trendy postmodernist studies insisted on Indigenous 'agency' under the guise of individual and collective empowerment, making the casualties of colonialism responsible for their own demise. Perhaps worst of all, some claimed (and still claim) that the colonizer and colonized experienced an 'encounter' and engaged in 'dialogue', thereby masking reality with justifications and rationalizations–in short, apologies for one-sided robbery and murder. In focusing on 'cultural change' and 'conflict between cultures', these studies avoid fundamental questions about the formation of the United States and its implications for the present and future. This approach to history allows one to safely put aside present responsibility for continued harm done by that past and the questions of reparations, restitution, and reordering society.
* "Multiculturalism became the cutting edge of post-civil-rights movement US history revisionism. For this scheme to work–and affirm US historical progress–Indigenous nations and communities had to be left out of the picture. As territorially and treaty-based peoples in North America, they did not fit the grid of multiculturalism but were included by transforming them into an inchoate oppressed racial group, while colonized Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans were dissolved into another such group, variously called "Hispanic" or "Latino." The multicultural approach emphasized the 'contributions' of individuals from oppressed groups to the country's assumed greatness. Indigenous peoples were thus credited with corn, beans, buckskin, log cabins, parkas, maple syrup, canoes, hundreds of place names, Thanksgiving, and even the concepts of democracy and federalism. But this idea of the gift-giving Indian helping to establish and enrich the development of the United States **is an insidious smoke screen meant to obscure the fact that the very existence of the country is a result of the looting of an entire continent and its resources**. The fundamental unresolved issues of Indigenous lands, treaties, and sovereignty could not but scuttle the premises of multiculturalism." p. 5
* "With multiculturalism, manifest destiny won the day. As an example, in 1994, Prentice Hall (part of Pearson Education) published a new college-level US history textbook, authored by four members of a new generation of revisionist historians. These radical social historians are all brilliant scholars with posts in prestigious universities. The book's title reflects the intent of its authors and publisher: *Out of Many: A History of the American People*. The origin story of a supposedly unitary nation, albeit now multicultural, remained intact. The original cover design featured a multicolored woven fabric–this image meant to stand in place of the discredited 'melting pot'.
* "With a traditional Navajo dwelling, a hogan, in the background, the woman was shown kneeling in front of a traditional loom, weaving a nearly finished rug. The design? The Stars and Stripes! The authors, upon hearing my objection and explanation that Navajo weavers make their livings off commissioned work that includes the desired design, responded: 'But it's a real photograph'. To the authors' credit, in the second edition they replaced the cover photograph and removed the Navajo picture inside, although the narrative text remains unchanged. 
* "Awareness of the settler-colonialist context of US history writing is essential...The form of colonialism that the Indigenous peoples of North America have experienced was modern from the beginning: the expansion of European corporations, backed by government armies, into foreign areas, with subsequent expropriation of lands and resources. Settler colonialism is a genocidal policy. Native nations and communities, while struggling to maintain fundamental values and collectivity, have from the beginning resisted modern colonialism using both defensive and offensive techniques, including the modern forms of armed resistance of national liberation movements and what now is called terrorism.
* "In every instance, Native nations have fought for survival as peoples. The objective of US colonialist authorities was to terminate their existence as peoples–not as random individuals. This is the very definition of modern genocide as contrasted with premodern instances of extreme violence that did not have the goal of extinction. The United States as a socioeconomic and political entity is a result of this centuries-long and ongoing colonial process. Modern Indigenous nations and communities are societies formed by their resistance to colonialism...It is breathtaking, but no miracle, that they have survived as peoples." p. 6-7
* "To say that the United States is a colonialist settler-state is not to make an accusation but rather to face historical reality, without which consideration not much in US history makes sense, unless Indigenous peoples are erased. **But Indigenous nations, through resistance, have survived and bear witness to this history.**"

### Neocolonialism p. 7
* During the second half of the 20th century, "the former colonial powers and their intellectual apologists mounted a counterforce, often called *neocolonialism*, from which multiculturalism and postmodernism emerged."
	* "Although much revisionist US history reflects neocolonialist strategy–**an attempt to accommodate new realities in order to retain the dominance**–neocolonialist methods signal victory for the colonized.
	* "Such ap­ proaches pry off a lid long kept tightly fastened.
	* "One result has been the presence of significant numbers of Indigenous scholars in US universities who are changing the terms of analysis. 
	* "The main challenge for scholars in revising US history in the context of colonialism is not lack of information, nor is it one of methodology. **Rather, the source of the problems has been the refusal or inability of US historians to comprehend the nature of their own history, US history. The fundamental problem is the absence of the colonial framework.**"" p. 7

### Settler Colonialism p. 7-8
	
* "Through economic penetration of Indigenous societies, the European and Euro-American colonial powers created economic dependency and imbalance of trade, then incorporated the Indigenous nations into spheres of influence and controlled them indirectly or as protectorates, with indispensable use of Christian missionaries and alcohol. In the case of US settler colonialism, **land was the primary commodity**. With such obvious indicators of colonialism at work, why should so many interpretations of US political-economic development be convoluted and obscure, avoiding the obvious? p. 7
* "...the twentieth-century emergence of the field of 'US West' or 'Borderlands' history has been forced into an incomplete and flawed settler-colonialist framework. The father of that field of history, FrederickJackson Turner, confessed as much in 1901: 'Our colonial system did not start with the Spanish War [1898]; the U.S. had had a colonial history and policy from the beginning of the Republic; but they have been hidden under the phraseology of *inter­state migration* and *territorial organization*.'" p. 7-8
* "The **notion that settler-indigenous conflict is an inevitable product of cultural differences and misunderstandings**, or that vio­lence was committed equally by the colonized and the colonizer, **blurs the nature of the historical processes**. 

### Genocidal policies p. 8-11

* "Euro-American colonial­ism, an aspect of the capitalist economic globalization, had from its beginnings a genocidal tendency...US history, as well as inherited Indigenous trauma, cannot be understood without dealing with the genocide that the United States committed against Indigenous peoples...The absence of even the slightest note of regret or tragedy in the annual celebration of the US independence betrays a deep disconnect in the consciousness of US Americans." p. 8-9
* "Ojibwe historian Jean O'Brien names the practice of writing Indians out of existence 'firsting and lasting'.
	* "All over the continent, local histories, monuments, and signage narrate the story of first settlement: the founder(s), the first school, first dwelling, first everything, as if there had never been occupants who thrived in those places before Euro-Americans. On the other hand, the national narrative tells of 'last' Indians or last tribes, such as 'the last of the Mohicans', 'Ishi, the last Indian', and *End of the Trail*, as a famous sculpture by James Earle Fraser is titled."
* Four distinct periods of offical genocidal policies by US administrations
	1. Jacksonian period of forced removal (1830s)
	2. California Gold Rush in Northern California (1849-1850s)
	3. post-Civil War era of the so-called Indian wars in the Great Plains (1850s-1870s)
	4. 1950s termination period
* 1873 quote from General William Sherman: 'We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children...during an assault, the soldiers can not pause to distinguish between male and female, or even discriminate as to age.' p. 9-10
* Patrick Wolfe: 'the peculiarity of settler colonialism is that the goal is elimination of Indigenous populations in order to make land available to settlers. That project is not limited to government policy, but rather involves all kinds of agencies, voluntary militias, and the settlers themselves acting on their own.' p. 10
* "There are more than 500 federally recognized Indigenous communities and nations–nearly 3 million people in the US." p. 10
