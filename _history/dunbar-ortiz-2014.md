## Introduction: This Land p. 1
* David Chang: 'Nation, race, and class converged in land.' p. 1
* Patrick Wolfe: 'The question of genocide is  never far from discussion of settler colonialism. Land is life–or, at least, land is necessary for life.' p. 2
* "The history of the United States is a history of settler colonialism–the foudning of a state based on the ideology of white supremacy, the widespread practice of African slavery, and a policy of genocide and land theft."
* "Traditionally, historians of the US hoping to have successful careers in academia and to author lucrative textbooks become protectors of this [Columbian - poetic Latinate name of the 19th century origin myth from the founding onward] origin myth. With the upheavals in the academic world during the 1960s, engendered by the civil rights movement and student activism, historians came to call for objectivity and fairness in revising interpretations of US history.
* "The warned against moralizing, urging instead a dispassionate and culturally relative approach. 
* Historian Bernard Sheehan, in an influential essay, called for a 'cultural conflict' understanding of Native-Euro-American relations in the early United States, writing that this approach 'diffuses the locus of guilt'. In striving for 'balance', however, historians spouted platitudes: 'There were good and bad people on both sides'. 'American culture is an amalgama­tion of all its ethnic groups'. 'A frontier is a zone of interaction between cultures, not merely advancing European settlements.'" p. 4
* "Later, trendy postmodernist studies insisted on Indigenous 'agency' under the guise of individual and collective empowerment, making the casualties of colonialism responsible for their own demise. Perhaps worst of all, some claimed (and still claim) that the colonizer and colonized experienced an 'encounter' and engaged in 'dialogue', thereby masking reality with justifications and rationalizations–in short, apologies for one-sided robbery and murder. In focusing on 'cultural change' and 'conflict between cultures', these studies avoid fundamental questions about the formation of the United States and its implications for the present and future. This approach to history allows one to safely put aside present responsibility for continued harm done by that past and the questions of reparations, restitution, and reordering society.
* "Multiculturalism became the cutting edge of post-civil-rights movement US history revisionism. For this scheme to work–and affirm US historical progress–Indigenous nations and communities had to be left out of the picture. As territorially and treaty-based peoples in North America, they did not fit the grid of multiculturalism but were included by transforming them into an inchoate oppressed racial group, while colonized Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans were dissolved into another such group, variously called "Hispanic" or "Latino." The multicultural approach emphasized the 'contributions' of individuals from oppressed groups to the country's assumed greatness. Indigenous peoples were thus credited with corn, beans, buckskin, log cabins, parkas, maple syrup, canoes, hundreds of place names, Thanksgiving, and even the concepts of democracy and federalism. But this idea of the gift-giving Indian helping to establish and enrich the development of the United States **is an insidious smoke screen meant to obscure the fact that the very existence of the country is a result of the looting of an entire continent and its resources**. The fundamental unresolved issues of Indigenous lands, treaties, and sovereignty could not but scuttle the premises of multiculturalism." p. 5
* "With multiculturalism, manifest destiny won the day. As an example, in 1994, Prentice Hall (part of Pearson Education) published a new college-level US history textbook, authored by four members of a new generation of revisionist historians. These radical social historians are all brilliant scholars with posts in prestigious universities. The book's title reflects the intent of its authors and publisher: *Out of Many: A History of the American People*. The origin story of a supposedly unitary nation, albeit now multicultural, remained intact. The original cover design featured a multicolored woven fabric–this image meant to stand in place of the discredited 'melting pot'.
* "With a traditional Navajo dwelling, a hogan, in the background, the woman was shown kneeling in front of a traditional loom, weaving a nearly finished rug. The design? The Stars and Stripes! The authors, upon hearing my objection and explanation that Navajo weavers make their livings off commissioned work that includes the desired design, responded: 'But it's a real photograph'. To the authors' credit, in the second edition they replaced the cover photograph and removed the Navajo picture inside, although the narrative text remains unchanged. p. 6
