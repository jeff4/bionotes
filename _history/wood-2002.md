### Introduction p. 1
* First edition of this book published in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis and default of Russian bonds in 1998. The current edition was published in 2002, after 9/11, the crash of the dotcom bubble, and the biggest US recession since the early 90s.
* The anticapitalist demonstrations (e.g., [1999 Seattle protests against the WTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests)) were "very clear about the conflict between the needs of people and the requirements of profrt, as manifested in everything from the growing gap between rich and poor to increasing ecological destruction."
	* However, those protesters were not always sure about whether 'globalization' and 'neoliberalism' were a more pernicious form of capitalism that could be excised from "good capitalism"; or if the problems of 1990s neoliberalism were essential and inextricable from the very nature of capitalism. 
* "But the conviction that there is and can be no alternative [to capitalism] is very deeply rooted, especially in Western culture. That conviction is supported not only by the more blatant expressions of capitalist ideology but also by some of our most cherished and unques­tioned beliefs...It is as if capitalism has always been the destination of historical movement and, more than that, the movement of history itself has from the beginning been driven by capitalist 'laws of motion'." p. 2 

### Chapter 1: The Commercialization Model and Its Legacy p. 11
* "The most common way of explaining the origin of capitalism is to presuppose that its  development is  the natural outcome of human practices almost as old as the species  itself, which required only the removal of external obstacles that hindered its realization. This mode of explanation, or non-explanation, which has existed in many variants, constitutes what has been called the **'commer­cialization model'** of  economic development, and this model is arguably still the dominant one. This is  so even among its harshest critics. It is not entirely absent from the demographic explanations that claim to have displaced it, or even from most Marxist accounts." p. 11

#### Summary of the Commercialization Model p. 11-14
* "The traditional account–which appears in  classical political economy, Enlightenment conceptions of progress, and many more modern histories–is as follows. With or  without a natural inclination to *'truck, barter, and exchange'* (in Adam Smith's famous formulation), rationally self-interested individuals have been engaging in acts of  exchange since the dawn of  history. These acts became increasingly specialized with an evolving division of labour, which was also accompanied by technical improvements in the instruments of production. Improvements in productivity, in many of  these explanations, may in fact have been the primary purpose of the increasingly specialized division of labour, so that there tends to be a close connection between these accounts of commercial development and a kind of tech­nological determinism. Capitalism, then, or 'commercial society', the highest stage of progress, represents a maturation of age-old commercial practices (together with technical advances) and their liberation from political and cultural constraints." p. 11-12
* "In these accounts [of the commercialization model], capitalism represents not so much a qualitative break from earlier forms as a massive quantitative increase: an expansion of markets and the growing commercialization of economic life." p. 12



### Chapter 4: Commerce or Capitalism?
* "The 'transition from feudalism to capitalism' is typically treated as a general European - or at least Western European - process. Yet European feudalism in Europe was internally diverse, and it produced several different outcomes, only one of which was capitalism." p. 73
* "It is not just a matter of different rates of 'combined and uneven development' or even of different transitional phases. The autonomous city-states that prospered in medieval and Renaissance Italy, for example, or the absolutist state in France, were distinct formations, each with its own internal logic of process that need not have given rise to capitalism." p. 73
#### Towns and Trade p. 74-80
#### Commerce and Basic Necessities p. 80-85
* p. 81-85 discussion of grain which was produced in the Baltic region and traded with the wealthier regions like the Netherlands which traded in luxuries. Shows how it was not competition in production like true capitalism but more about arbitrage.
* "Mercantile wealth depended precisely on the relative ·inaccessibility of mar­kets and the possibility of profiting from an endless process of arbitrage between fragmented markets." p. 84
*  Conclusion of grain trade discussion p. 84-85
	* "There was, then, a  fundamental separation between consump­tion and production. The social conditipns in which grain was produced in the exporting regions had very little to do with the conditions in which it was consumed in the rich commercial centres. This meant, among other things, that grain was cheap by the economic standards of the consuming powers, especially  in the wealthy Dutch Republic, whose merchants and superior shipping dominated the Baltic trade, without the enhancement of productive forces in the producing regions.  Nor-did low costs in the grain-producing regions impose competitive pressures on the consuming economies that benefited from cheap imports. On the contrary, the costs of producing other commodities in those wealthy commercial economies were  in effect reduced by access to such cheap basic 'inputs' At any rate, the trading advantages of the commercial leaders did not depend primarily on competi­tive production but on 'extra-economic' factors such as mon­opoly privileges, superior shipping, sophisticated commercial practices and instruments, elaborate commercial networks, far­flung trading posts, and military might. 
	* "These disjunctions certainly meant that, while rich commercial nations may have been dependent on the grain trade for the means of survival, the cost of the most basic survival needs was disproportionately low in relation to the wealth derived from commerce in less necessary goods.  But the same disjunctions also meant that  the commercial centres whose wealth depended on them were vulnerable to the fragilities of the international trade in superfluous goods. Not only their great wealth  but  even their supply of cheap and basic necessities could suffer from declines in the luxury trade."
