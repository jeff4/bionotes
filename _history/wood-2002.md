### Introduction p. 1
* First edition of this book published in 1999–after [the 1997 Asian financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis) and default of [Russian bonds in 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis). The current edition was published in 2002, after 9/11, the crash of the dotcom bubble, and the biggest US recession since the early 90s.
* The anticapitalist demonstrations (e.g., [1999 Seattle protests against the WTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests)) were "very clear about the conflict between the needs of people and the requirements of profit, as manifested in everything from the growing gap between rich and poor to increasing ecological destruction."
	* However, those protesters were not always sure about whether 'globalization' and 'neoliberalism' were a more pernicious form of capitalism that could be excised from "good capitalism"; or if the problems of 1990s neoliberalism were essential and inextricable from the very nature of capitalism. 
* "But the conviction that there is and can be no alternative [to capitalism] is very deeply rooted, especially in Western culture. That conviction is supported not only by the more blatant expressions of capitalist ideology but also by some of our most cherished and unques­tioned beliefs...It is as if capitalism has always been the destination of historical movement and, more than that, the movement of history itself has from the beginning been driven by capitalist 'laws of motion'." p. 2

#### Definition of capitalism p. 2-3
1. Capitalism is a system in which goods and services, down to the most basic necessities of life, are produced for profitable exchange, where even human labour-power is a commodity for sale in the market, and where all economic actors are dependent on the market.
1. This is true not only of workers, who must sell their labour-power for a wage, but also of capitalists, who depend on the market to buy their inputs, including labour-power, and to sell their output for profit.
1. Capitalism differs from other social forms because producers depend on the market for access to the means of production (unlike, for instance, peasants, who remain in direct, non-market possession of land); while appropriators cannot rely on 'extra-economic' powers of appropriation by means of direct coercion–such as the military, political, and judicial powers that enable feudal lords to extract surplus labour from peasants but must depend on the purely 'economic' mechanisms of the market. 
1. This distinct system of market depen­dence means that **the requirements of competition and profit­maximization are the fundamental rules of life.**
1. Because of those rules, capitalism is a system uniquely driven to improve the productivity of labour by technical means. 
1. **Above all, it is a system in which the bulk of society's work is done by propertyless labourers who are obliged to sell their labour-power in exchange for a wage in order to gain access to the means of life and of labour itself.**
1. In the process of supplying the needs and wants of society, workers are at the same time and inseparably creating profits for those who buy their labour-power. 
1. In fact, the production of goods and services is subordinate to the  production of capital and capitalist profit. The basic objective of the capitalist system, in other words, is  the production and self-expansion of capital. 

#### How old is 'capitalism'? p. 3
* "This distinctive way of supplying the material needs of human beings, so very different from all preceding ways of organizing material life and social reproduction, has existed for a very short time, barely a fraction of humanity's existence on earth. 
* **Even those who most emphatically insist on the system's roots in human nature and its natural continuity with age-old human practices would not claim that it really existed before the early modern period, and then only in Western Europe.**
* They may see bits of it in earlier periods, or detect its beginnings in the Middle Ages as a looming threat to a declining  feudalism but still constrained by feudal restrictions, or they may say that it  began with the expansion of trade or with voyages of discovery–with, say, Columbus's  explorations at  the end of the fifteenth century.
* Some might call these early forms 'proto-capitalism', but few would say that the capitalist system existed in earnest before the sixteenth or seventeenth century, and some would place it as  late as the eighteenth, or perhaps even the nineteenth, when it matured into its industrial form." 

#### 'Seeds of capitalism' p. 4-6
* "[Humans behaving as rational 'economic' actors are automatically] identified with 'exchange' or 'markets'...it is here that we can detect the assumption that the *seeds of capitalism are contained in the most primitive acts of exchange, in any form of trade or market activity*.
* "That assumption is  typically connected with the other presupposition: that history has been an almost natural process of technological development. One way or another, capitalism more or less naturally appears when and where expanding markets and technological development reach the right level, allowing sufficient wealth to be accumulated so that it  can be  profitably reinvested. 
* "Many Marxist explanations are funda­mentally the same–with the addition of bourgeois revolutions to help break the fetters. 
* "The effect of these explanations is to stress the *continuity* between non-capitalist and capitalist societies, and to deny or disguise the specificity of capitalism. Exchange has existed more or less forever, and it seems that the capitalist market is just more of the same. In this kind of argument, because capitalism's specific and unique need constantly to revolutionize the forces of produc­tion is just an extension and an acceleration of universal and transhistorical, almost *natural*, tendencies, industrialization is  the inevitable outcome of humanity's most basic inclinations. So the lineage of capitalism passes naturally from the earliest Babylonian merchant through the medieval burgher to the early modern bourgeois and finally to the industrial capitalist."
* "Central to these conventional accounts of history are certain assumptions, explicit or implicit, about human nature and about how human beings will behave, if only given the chance. They will, so the story goes, always avail themselves of the opportunity to maximize profit through acts of  exchange, and in order to realize that natural inclination, they will always fmd ways of improving the organization and instruments of  work in order to enhance the productivity of labour."

### Chapter 1: The Commercialization Model and Its Legacy p. 11
* "The most common way of explaining the origin of capitalism is to presuppose that its  development is  the natural outcome of human practices almost as old as the species  itself, which required only the removal of external obstacles that hindered its realization. This mode of explanation, or non-explanation, which has existed in many variants, constitutes what has been called the **'commer­cialization model'** of  economic development, and this model is arguably still the dominant one. This is  so even among its harshest critics. It is not entirely absent from the demographic explanations that claim to have displaced it, or even from most Marxist accounts." p. 11

#### Summary of the Commercialization Model p. 11-14
* "The traditional account–which appears in  classical political economy, Enlightenment conceptions of progress, and many more modern histories–is as follows. With or  without a natural inclination to *'truck, barter, and exchange'* (in Adam Smith's famous formulation), rationally self-interested individuals have been engaging in acts of  exchange since the dawn of  history. These acts became increasingly specialized with an evolving division of labour, which was also accompanied by technical improvements in the instruments of production. Improvements in productivity, in many of  these explanations, may in fact have been the primary purpose of the increasingly specialized division of labour, so that there tends to be a close connection between these accounts of commercial development and a kind of tech­nological determinism. Capitalism, then, or 'commercial society', the highest stage of progress, represents a maturation of age-old commercial practices (together with technical advances) and their liberation from political and cultural constraints." p. 11-12
* "In these accounts [of the commercialization model], capitalism represents not so much a qualitative break from earlier forms as a massive quantitative increase: an expansion of markets and the growing commercialization of economic life." p. 12



### Chapter 4: Commerce or Capitalism?
* "The 'transition from feudalism to capitalism' is typically treated as a general European - or at least Western European - process. Yet European feudalism in Europe was internally diverse, and it produced several different outcomes, only one of which was capitalism." p. 73
* "It is not just a matter of different rates of 'combined and uneven development' or even of different transitional phases. The autonomous city-states that prospered in medieval and Renaissance Italy, for example, or the absolutist state in France, were distinct formations, each with its own internal logic of process that need not have given rise to capitalism." p. 73
#### Towns and Trade p. 74-80
#### Commerce and Basic Necessities p. 80-85
* p. 81-85 discussion of grain which was produced in the Baltic region and traded with the wealthier regions like the Netherlands which traded in luxuries. Shows how it was not competition in production like true capitalism but more about arbitrage.
* "Mercantile wealth depended precisely on the relative inaccessibility of markets and the possibility of profiting from an endless process of arbitrage between fragmented markets." p. 84
*  Conclusion of grain trade discussion p. 84-85
	* "There was, then, a  fundamental separation between consumption and production. The social conditipns in which grain was produced in the exporting regions had very little to do with the conditions in which it was consumed in the rich commercial centres. This meant, among other things, that grain was cheap by the economic standards of the consuming powers, especially  in the wealthy Dutch Republic, whose merchants and superior shipping dominated the Baltic trade, without the enhancement of productive forces in the producing regions.  Nor-did low costs in the grain-producing regions impose competitive pressures on the consuming economies that benefited from cheap imports. On the contrary, the costs of producing other commodities in those wealthy commercial economies were  in effect reduced by access to such cheap basic 'inputs' At any rate, the trading advantages of the commercial leaders did not depend primarily on competitive production but on 'extra-economic' factors such as monopoly privileges, superior shipping, sophisticated commercial practices and instruments, elaborate commercial networks, far-flung trading posts, and military might. 
	* "These disjunctions certainly meant that, while rich commercial nations may have been dependent on the grain trade for the means of survival, the cost of the most basic survival needs was disproportionately low in relation to the wealth derived from commerce in less necessary goods.  But the same disjunctions also meant that  the commercial centres whose wealth depended on them were vulnerable to the fragilities of the international trade in superfluous goods. Not only their great wealth  but  even their supply of cheap and basic necessities could suffer from declines in the luxury trade."
