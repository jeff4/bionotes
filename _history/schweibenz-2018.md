## Examples
### da Vinci's The Last Supper 1495-1498 (last few years of the 15th century)

### Vermeer's The Milkmaid 1660

### Veronese's The Wedding at Cana 1563
* In 1797, Napoloen's armies looted it from Venice and brought it back to France. For the last few hundred years, it's been displayed in the Louvre in Paris.
* In 2006, a team including the Factum Arte digitally scanned and 'mechanically' reproduced a replica to be placed back in it's original site at the San Giorgio Maggiore cloister in Venice.
* Bruce Latour and Adam Lowe argue that this causes a cognitive dissonance, a disruption because the flawless reproduction in the original location seems more 'original' than the distan painting in the louvre.
* In effect, Benjamin confused the notion of ‘mechanical reproduction’ with the inequality in the techniques employed along a trajectory. No matter how mechanical a reproduction is, once there is no huge gap in the process of production between version n and version n+1, the clear cut distinction between the original and its reproduction becomes less crucial—and the aura begins to hesitate and is uncertain where it should land (Latour and Lowe 2011, p.283).

### A Digital Rembrandt 2016
* "the Next Rembrandt" using 150 GB of graphic data, a deep learning algorithm absorbed 346 Rembrandt paintings, and facial recognition software analyzed 168,263 fragments of scans.

### French artist group Obvious
* In 2018, Christie's auctioned off a painting for $450k painting that was generated by an algorithm. This was almost 50x higher than the original predicted selling price.
