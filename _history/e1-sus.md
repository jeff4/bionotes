## Intro Material
* 2020 Reprint of 1975 Edition by Foreign Languages Press.

## To do
* Reread from end of p.24 'The new starting-point was a compromise between the rising middle class and the ex-feudal landwoners. The latter, though called, as now, the aristocracy, had been long since on the way which led them to become what Louis Philippe in France became..."the first bourgeois of the kingdom".'

## Chapter 1 p. 39-53
* p.39. Two main ideas: (1) class antagonism between proprietors and non-proprieters and (2) 'anarchy in production'.
* Examples of forerunners to 19th century prol: "(1) the Anabaptists and Thomas Munzer during the Reformation and Peasant's War; (2) the True Levellers and egalitarian Diggers during the English Revolution of 1650s; and (3) Gracchus Babeuf and the Conspiracy of Equals during the French Revolution." p.40-41
* Introduction to Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen on p.41, details on their works from p.43.
* '...the French philosophers [of the 1700s] appealed to reason as the sole judge of everything...But when the French Revolution had realized this rational society and state, the new order of things, however rational as compared with earlier conditions, proved to be by no means absolutely rational. The state based upon reason completely collapsed. Rousseau’s social contract had found its realization in the Reign of Terror, from which the bourgeoisie, after losing faith in its own political capacity, had taken refuge first in the corruption of the Directorate and finally under the wing of the Napoleonic despotism. The promised eternal peace was turned into an endless war of conquest. The society based upon reason had fared no better.' p.42 
* For small capitalists and peasants, the 'freedom of property' turned out to just be 'freedom from property' as they were forced to sell whatever they had under 'overpowering competition [from] big capital and big landed property.' p.42
 
### Saint-Simon p. 45-46
* Saint-Simon: antagonism is between 'workers' vs. 'idlers'. 'The idlers were not merely the old privileged persons, but all who lived on their incomes without taking any part in production or distribution. The “workers” were not only the wage-workers but also the manufacturers, the merchants, the bankers.' p.45
* Who then was to lead? 'According to Saint-Simon, science and industry, both united by a new religious bond destined to restore that unity of religious ideas which had been broken since the Reformation—a necessarily mystical and rigidly hierarchical “new Christianity”. But science was the scholars; and industry was, in the first place, the active bourgeois, manufacturers, merchants, bankers.' p.45
* F: '...to recognize the French Revolution as a...struggle and not simply as one between nobility and bourgeoisie, but *between nobility, bourgeoisie, and those without any property, was*, in the year 1802, a discovery of the greatest genius." 

### Fourier p. 46-49
* Fourier 'mercilessly lays bare the material and moral misery of the bourgeois world'. Great satirist and 'the first to declare that in any given society the degree of women's emancipation i the natural measure of the general emancipation.' p.46
* Four stages of development for society:  (1) savagery, (2) patriarchy, (3) barbarism, (4) bourgeois society. p.47
* Fourier 'shows that **the civilized order gives every vice practised by barbarism in a simple fashion a complex, ambiguous, equivocal, hypocritical form**; that civilization moves in "a vicious circle", in contradictions which it constantly reproduces without being able to solve, so that it constantly attains the opposite of what it wants to achieve, or pretends it wants to achieve. So that, for example, *under civilization poverty is born of abundance itself*'. p.48
* Industrial Revolution in England in the 1700-mid-1800s. Rise of Modern Large Scale industry, 'revolutionizing the whole foundation of bourgeois society'. Formerly sedate pace of development turned into a storm of production. 'The division of society into big capitalists and propertyless proletarians went on with ever-increasing rapidity; between these, instead of the former stable middle estate, an unstable mass of artisans and small shopkeepers, which constituted the most fluctuating section of the population, now led a precarious existence.' p.48 
* Even though this was still the nascent stage of industrial acceleration, it was already 'producing crying social abuses—the herding together of a homeless population in the worst quarters of the large towns; the dissolution of all traditional bonds of descent, of patriarchal subordination, of the family; overwork, especially of women and children, on an appalling scale; massive demoralization of the working class, suddenly flung into altogether new conditions, from the country into the town, from agriculture into industry, from stable conditions of existence into insecure ones changing from day to day.' p.48-49

### Robert Owen p. 49-52
* p.49-52 Discusses Owen's startling social and economic success with the cotton-spinning mill at New Lanark in Scotland from 1800-1829.
	* Grew it to 2500 inhabitants, invented schools for toddlers, paid workers full wages even when mill was stopped by external economic forces, limited working day to 10.5 hours at a time when competitors forced their workers to labor for 13-14 hours per day.
	* 'In spite of all this, Owen was not content. The existence he had contrived for his workers was, in his eyes, still far from being worthy of human beings. **"The people were slaves at my mercy."** The relatively favourable conditions in which he had placed them were still far from allowing an all-round rational development of the character and of the intellect, much less the free exercise of all their faculties.' p.50.
	* 2500 persons were creating as much real wealth daily as a population of 600,000 did merely 50 years earlier. 'I asked myself what became of the difference between the wealth consumed by 2,500 persons and that which would have been consumed by 600,000?' p.50
	* The answer was profits to the owners, despite the fact that factories like his are what saved England from Napoleon. 
	* Owen drew up a practical, detailed plan to reconstruct things in an even better way.
* But this all changed when he began wanting to do more than simple philanthropy. 
* 'As long as he was simply a philanthropist, he was rewarded with nothing but wealth, applause, honour, and glory. He was the most popular man in Europe. Not only men of his own class, but statesmen and princes listened to him approvingly. **But when he came out with his communist theories, it was quite a different story.**' p.51
* 'Banished from official society, with a conspiracy of silence against him in the press, and ruined by his unsuccessful communist experiments in America in which he sacrificed all his fortune, he turned directly to the working class and continued working in their midst for thirty years.' p.51
* 'Every social movement, every real advance in England on behalf of the workers is linked with Owen’s name.' p.51 

### Conclusion of Chapter 1 p. 52-53
* 'The Utopians’ outlook has governed the socialist ideas of the nineteenth century for a long time and in part still does. Until very recently all French and English socialists paid homage to it. The earlier German communism, including that of Weitling, also belongs to it. To all these, socialism is the expression of absolute truth, reason and justice and needs only to be discovered to conquer the world by virtue of its own power; as absolute truth is independent of time, space, and human historical development, it is a mere accident when and where it is discovered. At the same time, absolute truth, reason and justice are different for the founder of each different school; and as each one’s special brand of absolute truth, reason and justice is in turn conditioned by his subjective understanding, his conditions of existence, the measure of his knowledge and his intellectual training, there is no other ending possible in this conflict of absolute truths than that they should grind each other down. 
* 'Hence, from this nothing could come but a kind of eclectic, average socialism, such as in fact has dominated the minds of most of the socialist workers in France and England up to the present time; a mish-mash permitting of the most manifold shades of opinion; a mish-mash of the less striking critical statements, economic theories and pictures of future society of the founders of different sects; a mish-mash which is the more easily produced, the more the sharp edges of precision of the individual constituents are rubbed down in the stream of debate, like rounded pebbles in a brook. To make a science of socialism, it had first to be placed upon a real basis.' p.53

## Chapter 2 p. 55-

* Hegel's inheritance of classical Greek dialectics: 'the old Greek philosophers were all born dialecticians and Aristotle--the most encyclopedic intellect among them--had already investigated the most essential forms of dialectical thought.' p.55
* Brief sketch of two modes of thought: (1) metaphysical vs (2) materialist. Starts on second paragraph of p.55. Ends near middle of p.61.
* 'In 1831, the first working-class rising took place in Lyons; between 1838 and 1842, the first national working-class movement, that of the English Chartists, reached its height. The class struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie came to the front in the history of the most advanced countries in Europe in proportion to the development, on the one hand, of modern industry, and on the other, of the recently acquired political supremacy of the bourgeoisie.' p. 61
* 'Facts more and more strenuously gave the lie to the teachings of bourgeois economics on the identity of the interests of capital and labour, on the general har- mony and general prosperity flowing from free competition. None of these things could be ignored any longer, any more than the French and English socialism, which was their theoretical, though extremely imperfect, expression. But the old idealist conception of history, which was not yet dislodged, knew nothing of class struggles based on material interests, indeed knew nothing at all of material interests; production and all economic relations appeared in it only as incidental, subordinate elements in the "history of civilization." p.61 
* 'The new facts made imperative a new examination of *all* past history. Then it was seen that all past history, with the exception of its primitive stages, was the history of class struggles; that these social classes warring with each other are always the products of the relations of production and exchange—in a word, of the economic relations of their epoch; that therefore the economic structure of society always forms the real basis, from which, in the last analysis, the whole superstructure of legal and political institutions as well as of the religious, philosophical, and other ideas of a given historical period is to be explained.' p.61-62
* **'Hegel had freed the conception of history from metaphysics—he had made it dia- lectical; but his conception of history was essentially idealistic.'**
* 'But now idealism was driven from its last refuge, the conception of history; now a materialistic treatment of history was advanced, and the way found to explain man’s consciousness by his being, instead of, as heretofore, his being by his consciousness.' 
* 'Henceforward socialism no longer appeared as an accidental discovery by this or that intellect of genius, but as the necessary outcome of the struggle between two classes produced by history--the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.'
* 'Its task was no longer to manufacture as perfect a system of society as possible, but to examine the historico-economic process from which these classes and their antagonism had of necessity sprung and to discover in the economic situation thus created the means of ending the conflict.'
* 'But the earlier socialism was just as incompatible with this materialist conception of history as the French materialists’ conception of nature was with dialectics and modern natural science.'
* 'The earlier socialism certainly criticized the existing capitalist mode of production and its consequences. But it could not explain this mode of production, and, therefore, could not get the mastery of it. It could only simply reject it as evil. The more violently it denounced the exploita- tion of the working class, which is inseparable from capitalism, the less able was it clearly to show in what this exploitation consists and how it arises. But for this it was necessary, on the one hand, to present the capitalist mode of production in its historical interconnection and its necessity for a specific historical period, and therefore also the necessity of its doom; and, on the other, to lay bare its essential character, which was still hidden.' p.62 
* **'This was done by the discovery of surplus value.'**
* 'It was shown that the appropriation of unpaid labor is the basic form of the capitalist mode of production and of the exploitation of the worker effected by it; that even if the capitalist buys the labour-power of his worker at the full value it possesses as a commodity on the market, he still extracts more value from it than he paid for; and that in the last analysis this surplus-value forms those sums of value from which there is heaped up the constantly increasing mass of capital in the hands of the possessing classes. The process both of capitalist production and of the production of capital was explained.' p. 62-63
* 'These two great discoveries, the materialist conception of history and the revelation of the secret of capitalist production through surplus-value, we owe to Marx. With them socialism became a science, which had now to be elaborated in all its details and interconnections.' p.63
