## Intro Material
* 2020 Reprint of 1975 Edition by Foreign Languages Press.

## To do
* Reread from end of p.24 'The new starting-point was a compromise between the rising middle class and the ex-feudal landwoners. The latter, though called, as now, the aristocracy, had been long since on the way which led them to become what Louis Philippe in France became..."the first bourgeois of the kingdom".'

## Chapter 1 p. 39-53
* p.39. Two main ideas: (1) class antagonism between proprietors and non-proprieters and (2) 'anarchy in production'.
* Examples of forerunners to 19th century prol: "(1) the Anabaptists and Thomas Munzer during the Reformation and Peasant's War; (2) the True Levellers and egalitarian Diggers during the English Revolution of 1650s; and (3) Gracchus Babeuf and the Conspiracy of Equals during the French Revolution." p.40-41
* Introduction to Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen on p.41, details on their works from p.43.
* '...the French philosophers [of the 1700s] appealed to reason as the sole judge of everything...But when the French Revolution had realized this rational society and state, the new order of things, however rational as compared with earlier conditions, proved to be by no means absolutely rational. The state based upon reason completely collapsed. Rousseau’s social contract had found its realization in the Reign of Terror, from which the bourgeoisie, after losing faith in its own political capacity, had taken refuge first in the corruption of the Directorate and finally under the wing of the Napoleonic despotism. The promised eternal peace was turned into an endless war of conquest. The society based upon reason had fared no better.' p.42 
* For small capitalists and peasants, the 'freedom of property' turned out to just be 'freedom from property' as they were forced to sell whatever they had under 'overpowering competition [from] big capital and big landed property.' p.42
 
### Saint-Simon p. 45-46
* Saint-Simon: antagonism is between 'workers' vs. 'idlers'. 'The idlers were not merely the old privileged persons, but all who lived on their incomes without taking any part in production or distribution. The “workers” were not only the wage-workers but also the manufacturers, the merchants, the bankers.' p.45
* Who then was to lead? 'According to Saint-Simon, science and industry, both united by a new religious bond destined to restore that unity of religious ideas which had been broken since the Reformation—a necessarily mystical and rigidly hierarchical “new Christianity”. But science was the scholars; and industry was, in the first place, the active bourgeois, manufacturers, merchants, bankers.' p.45
* F: '...to recognize the French Revolution as a...struggle and not simply as one between nobility and bourgeoisie, but *between nobility, bourgeoisie, and those without any property, was*, in the year 1802, a discovery of the greatest genius." 

### Fourier p. 46-49
* Fourier 'mercilessly lays bare the material and moral misery of the bourgeois world'. Great satirist and 'the first to declare that in any given society the degree of women's emancipation i the natural measure of the general emancipation.' p.46
* Four stages of development for society:  (1) savagery, (2) patriarchy, (3) barbarism, (4) bourgeois society. p.47
* Fourier 'shows that **the civilized order gives every vice practised by barbarism in a simple fashion a complex, ambiguous, equivocal, hypocritical form**; that civilization moves in "a vicious circle", in contradictions which it constantly reproduces without being able to solve, so that it constantly attains the opposite of what it wants to achieve, or pretends it wants to achieve. So that, for example, *under civilization poverty is born of abundance itself*'. p.48
* Industrial Revolution in England in the 1700-mid-1800s. Rise of Modern Large Scale industry, 'revolutionizing the whole foundation of bourgeois society'. Formerly sedate pace of development turned into a storm of production. 'The division of society into big capitalists and propertyless proletarians went on with ever-increasing rapidity; between these, instead of the former stable middle estate, an unstable mass of artisans and small shopkeepers, which constituted the most fluctuating section of the population, now led a precarious existence.' p.48 
* Even though this was still the nascent stage of industrial acceleration, it was already 'producing crying social abuses—the herding together of a homeless population in the worst quarters of the large towns; the dissolution of all traditional bonds of descent, of patriarchal subordination, of the family; overwork, especially of women and children, on an appalling scale; massive demoralization of the working class, suddenly flung into altogether new conditions, from the country into the town, from agriculture into industry, from stable conditions of existence into insecure ones changing from day to day.' p.48-49

### Robert Owen p. 49-52
* p.49-52 Discusses Owen's startling social and economic success with the cotton-spinning mill at New Lanark in Scotland from 1800-1829.
	* Grew it to 2500 inhabitants, invented schools for toddlers, paid workers full wages even when mill was stopped by external economic forces, limited working day to 10.5 hours at a time when competitors forced their workers to labor for 13-14 hours per day.
	* 'In spite of all this, Owen was not content. The existence he had contrived for his workers was, in his eyes, still far from being worthy of human beings. **"The people were slaves at my mercy."** The relatively favourable conditions in which he had placed them were still far from allowing an all-round rational development of the character and of the intellect, much less the free exercise of all their faculties.' p.50.
	* 2500 persons were creating as much real wealth daily as a population of 600,000 did merely 50 years earlier. 'I asked myself what became of the difference between the wealth consumed by 2,500 persons and that which would have been consumed by 600,000?' p.50
	* The answer was profits to the owners, despite the fact that factories like his are what saved England from Napoleon. 
	* Owen drew up a practical, detailed plan to reconstruct things in an even better way.
* But this all changed when he began wanting to do more than simple philanthropy. 
* 'As long as he was simply a philanthropist, he was rewarded with nothing but wealth, applause, honour, and glory. He was the most popular man in Europe. Not only men of his own class, but statesmen and princes listened to him approvingly. **But when he came out with his communist theories, it was quite a different story.**' p.51
* 'Banished from official society, with a conspiracy of silence against him in the press, and ruined by his unsuccessful communist experiments in America in which he sacrificed all his fortune, he turned directly to the working class and continued working in their midst for thirty years.' p.51
* 'Every social movement, every real advance in England on behalf of the workers is linked with Owen’s name.' p.51 

### Conclusion of Chapter 1 p. 52-53
* 'The Utopians’ outlook has governed the socialist ideas of the nineteenth century for a long time and in part still does. Until very recently all French and English socialists paid homage to it. The earlier German communism, including that of Weitling, also belongs to it. To all these, socialism is the expression of absolute truth, reason and justice and needs only to be discovered to conquer the world by virtue of its own power; as absolute truth is independent of time, space, and human historical development, it is a mere accident when and where it is discovered. At the same time, absolute truth, reason and justice are different for the founder of each different school; and as each one’s special brand of absolute truth, reason and justice is in turn conditioned by his subjective understanding, his conditions of existence, the measure of his knowledge and his intellectual training, there is no other ending possible in this conflict of absolute truths than that they should grind each other down. 
* 'Hence, from this nothing could come but a kind of eclectic, average socialism, such as in fact has dominated the minds of most of the socialist workers in France and England up to the present time; a mish-mash permitting of the most manifold shades of opinion; a mish-mash of the less striking critical statements, economic theories and pictures of future society of the founders of different sects; a mish-mash which is the more easily produced, the more the sharp edges of precision of the individual constituents are rubbed down in the stream of debate, like rounded pebbles in a brook. To make a science of socialism, it had first to be placed upon a real basis.' p.53

## Chapter 2 p. 55-63

* Hegel's inheritance of classical Greek dialectics: 'the old Greek philosophers were all born dialecticians and Aristotle--the most encyclopedic intellect among them--had already investigated the most essential forms of dialectical thought.' p.55
* Brief sketch of two modes of thought: (1) metaphysical vs (2) materialist. Starts on second paragraph of p.55. Ends near middle of p.61.
* 'In 1831, the first working-class rising took place in Lyons; between 1838 and 1842, the first national working-class movement, that of the English Chartists, reached its height. The class struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie came to the front in the history of the most advanced countries in Europe in proportion to the development, on the one hand, of modern industry, and on the other, of the recently acquired political supremacy of the bourgeoisie.' p. 61
* 'Facts more and more strenuously gave the lie to the teachings of bourgeois economics on the identity of the interests of capital and labour, on the general har- mony and general prosperity flowing from free competition. None of these things could be ignored any longer, any more than the French and English socialism, which was their theoretical, though extremely imperfect, expression. But the old idealist conception of history, which was not yet dislodged, knew nothing of class struggles based on material interests, indeed knew nothing at all of material interests; production and all economic relations appeared in it only as incidental, subordinate elements in the "history of civilization." p.61 
* 'The new facts made imperative a new examination of *all* past history. Then it was seen that all past history, with the exception of its primitive stages, was the history of class struggles; that these social classes warring with each other are always the products of the relations of production and exchange—in a word, of the economic relations of their epoch; that therefore the economic structure of society always forms the real basis, from which, in the last analysis, the whole superstructure of legal and political institutions as well as of the religious, philosophical, and other ideas of a given historical period is to be explained.' p.61-62
* **'Hegel had freed the conception of history from metaphysics—he had made it dia- lectical; but his conception of history was essentially idealistic.'**
* 'But now idealism was driven from its last refuge, the conception of history; now a materialistic treatment of history was advanced, and the way found to explain man’s consciousness by his being, instead of, as heretofore, his being by his consciousness.' 
* 'Henceforward socialism no longer appeared as an accidental discovery by this or that intellect of genius, but as the necessary outcome of the struggle between two classes produced by history--the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.'
* 'Its task was no longer to manufacture as perfect a system of society as possible, but to examine the historico-economic process from which these classes and their antagonism had of necessity sprung and to discover in the economic situation thus created the means of ending the conflict.'
* 'But the earlier socialism was just as incompatible with this materialist conception of history as the French materialists’ conception of nature was with dialectics and modern natural science.'
* 'The earlier socialism certainly criticized the existing capitalist mode of production and its consequences. But it could not explain this mode of production, and, therefore, could not get the mastery of it. It could only simply reject it as evil. The more violently it denounced the exploita- tion of the working class, which is inseparable from capitalism, the less able was it clearly to show in what this exploitation consists and how it arises. But for this it was necessary, on the one hand, to present the capitalist mode of production in its historical interconnection and its necessity for a specific historical period, and therefore also the necessity of its doom; and, on the other, to lay bare its essential character, which was still hidden.' p.62 
* **'This was done by the discovery of surplus value.'**
* 'It was shown that the appropriation of unpaid labor is the basic form of the capitalist mode of production and of the exploitation of the worker effected by it; that even if the capitalist buys the labour-power of his worker at the full value it possesses as a commodity on the market, he still extracts more value from it than he paid for; and that in the last analysis this surplus-value forms those sums of value from which there is heaped up the constantly increasing mass of capital in the hands of the possessing classes. The process both of capitalist production and of the production of capital was explained.' p. 62-63
* 'These two great discoveries, the materialist conception of history and the revelation of the secret of capitalist production through surplus-value, we owe to Marx. With them socialism became a science, which had now to be elaborated in all its details and interconnections.' p.63

## Chapter 3 p. 65-85
* 'The materialist conception of history starts from the principle that production and, next to production, the exchange of things produced, is the basis of every social order; that in every society that has appeared in history, the distribution of weatlh and with it the division of society into classes...are dependent upon what is produced, how it is produced, and how the products are exchanged.' p.65
* '[Thus], the ultimate causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in men's brains, not in their growing insight into eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange.' p.65
* 'They are sought, not in the *philosophy* but in the *economics* of each particular epoch.'
* 'The growing recognition that existing social institutions are irrational and unjust, that reason has become unreason, and kindness a scourge, is only a sign that changes in the modes of production and exchange have silently been taking place with which the social order adapted to earlier economic conditions is no longer in keeping.
* 'From this it also follows that the means of eliminating the abuses that have been brought to light must also be present, in a more or less developed condition, within the changed relations of production themselves. 
* 'These means are not to be invented out of one’s brain, but discovered by the brain in the existing material facts of production.
* 'It is now pretty generally conceded that the existing social order is the creation of the ruling class of today, of the bourgeoisie. 
* 'The mode of production peculiar to the bourgeoisie, which since Marx has been called the capitalist mode of production, was incompatible with the local privileges and the privileges of estate as well as with the reciprocal personal ties of the feudal system. The bourgeoisie shattered the feudal system and on its ruins built the bourgeois social order, the realm of free competition, of freedom of movement, of equal rights for commodity owners and all the glories of capitalism.' p.65

### Industrial Revolution p. 66
* 'Since steam and the new tool-making machinery transformed the older manufacture into large-scale industry, the productive forces evolved under the guidance of the bourgeoisie developed with a rapidity and on a scale unheard of before. 
* 'But just as manufacture and the handicraft industries, which had experienced a further growth under its influence, had come into conflict with the feudal trammels of the guilds in their time, so large-scale industry, in its more complete development, now comes into conflict with the barriers within which the capitalist mode of production holds it confined. 
* 'The new productive forces have already outgrown the bourgeois form of using them; and this conflict between productive forces and mode of production is not a conflict engendered in men’s heads, like that between original sin and divine justice, but it exists in the facts, objectively, outside us, independently of the will and even actions of the men who have brought it on. 
* 'Modern socialism is nothing but the reflex in thought of this actual conflict, its ideal reflection in the minds of above all the class directly suffering under it, the working class. 
* 'Now, in what does this conflict consist?
* 'Prior to capitalist production, i.e., in the Middle Ages, small-scale production generally prevailed, based upon the workers’ private ownership of their means of production: the agriculture of the small peasant, freeman or serf, and the handicrafts in the towns. The instruments of labour--land, agricultural implements, the workshop, the hand tool--were the instruments of labour of single individuals, adapted for indi- vidual use, and, therefore, of necessity puny, dwarfish, circumscribed. But for this very reason they normally belonged to the producer him- self. To concentrate these scattered, limited means of production, to enlarge them, to turn them into the powerful levers of production of the present day was precisely the historic role of the capitalist mode of production and of its upholder, the bourgeoisie.
* 'In Part IV of Capital Marx gives a detailed account of how the bourgeoisie has historically accomplished this since the fifteenth century through the three phases of simple cooperation, manufacture and large-scale industry.' p.66
* 'But as is also shown there, the bourgeoisie could not transform these limited means of production into mighty productive forces without at the same time transforming them from individual means of production into social means of production only workable by a collectivity of men. The spinning wheel, the hand-loom and the blacksmith’s hammer were replaced by the spinning machine, the power-loom and the steam hammer, and the individual workshop by the factory commanding the co-operation of hundreds and thousands of workmen. Like the means of production, production itself changed from a series of individual operations into a series of social acts, and the products from individual into social products. 
* 'The yarn, the cloth and the metal goods that now came out of the factory were the common product of many workers, through whose hands they had successively to pass before they were ready. No one per- son could say of them: "I made that, this is my product."
* 'But where the spontaneous division of labour within society, a division of labour which arose gradually and planlessly, is the fundamental form of production, it imprints on the products the form of commodities, the mutual exchange, purchase and sale of which enable the individual producers to satisfy their manifold wants. This was the case in the Middle Ages. The peasant, for example, sold the artisan agricultural products and bought from him the products of his craft.
* 'The new mode of production infiltrated this society of individual producers, of commodity producers. It set up the planned division of labour, as it was organized in the individual factory, in the midst of the spontaneous, planless division of labour such as then prevailed throughout society; side by side with individual production, social production made its appearance. The products of both were sold in the same market, and, consequently, at the same prices, at least approximately. 
* 'But planned organization was stronger than the spontaneous division of labour; the factories working socially produced their commodities more cheaply than the isolated small producers. Individual production succumbed in one field after another. Social production totally revolutionized the old mode of production. But this, its revolutionary, character was so little recognized that it was, on the contrary, introduced as a means of increasing and promoting commodity production.' p.67
* 'In its origin, it was directly tied up with certain already existing levers of commodity production and exchange: merchant capital, handicrafts, wage-labour. Since social production itself appeared as a new form of commodity production, the old forms of appropriation characteristic of commodity production remained in full force for it too.
* 'In commodity production as it had developed in the Middle Ages, any question concerning the identity of the owner of the product of labour just couldn’t arise. The individual producer had generally produced it from his own raw material, which was often his own handiwork, with his own instruments of labour, and by his own or his family’s manual labour. There was no need whatever for him to appropriate the product to begin with, it belonged to him wholly as a matter of course. His ownership of the product was therefore based upon his own labour. Even where outside help was used, it was generally of little importance, and often received other compensation in addition to wages; the guild apprentice and journeyman worked less for board and wages than for training to become master craftsmen themselves.
* 'Then came the concentration of the means of production in large workshops and manufactories, their transformation into actual social means of production. But the social means of production and prod- ucts were treated as if they were still the means of production and the products of individuals they had been before. Hitherto, the owner of the instruments of labour had appropriated the product, because it was normally his own product and the auxiliary labour of others was the exception. Now the owner of the instruments of labour continued to appropriate the product, although it was no longer his product, but exclusively the product of the labour of others.
* 'Thus, the products which were now turned out socially were not appropriated by those who had actually set the means of production in motion and actually turned out the products, but by the capitalists. The means of production and production itself have become social in essence. But they are subjected to a form of appropriation which presupposes private production by individuals, and under which, therefore, everyone owns his own product and brings it to market." p.68
* 'The mode of production is subjected to this form of appropriation, although it removes the presupposition on which the latter rests. The whole conflict of today is already present in embryo in this contradiction which gives the new mode of production its capitalist character. The more the new mode of production became dominant in all decisive fields of production and in all economically decisive countries, and the more it reduced individual production to an insignificant residue, the more glaring did the incompatibility of social production with capitalist appropriation necessarily become.
* 'As we have said, the first capitalists found the form of wage-labour already in existence. But wage-labour as the exception, as a side-occupation, as an auxiliary, as a transitory phase. The agricultural labourer who occasionally went to work as a day labourer had a few acres of his own land, from which alone he could get his living in a pinch. The regulations of the guilds ensured that the journeyman of today became the master craftsman of tomorrow. But this changed as soon as the means of production became social and were concentrated in the hands of capitalists.
* 'Both the means of production and the products of the small individual producer increasingly depreciated in value; there was nothing left for him to do but to go to the capitalist and work for wages. From being an exception and an auxiliary, wage-labour became the rule and the basic form of all production; from being a side-occupation, it now became the worker’s exclusive activity. The occasional wage-worker was transformed into the wage-worker for life. Furthermore, the number of lifelong wage-workers was enormously increased by the simultaneous collapse of the feudal system, the disbanding of the feudal lords’ retain- ers, the eviction of peasants from their homesteads, etc.' p.69
* 'The separation of the means of production concentrated in the hands of the capital- ists, on the one side, from the producers now possessing nothing but their labour-power, on the other, was accomplished. The contradiction between social production and capitalist appropriation became manifest as the antagonism between proletariat and bourgeoisie.
* 'We have seen that the capitalist mode of production infiltrated a society of commodity producers, individual producers, whose social nexus was mediated through the exchange of their products. But every society based on commodity production has the peculiarity that the producers in it have lost command over their own social relations. Each produces for himself with the means of production which happen to be at his disposal and in order to satisfy his individual needs through exchange. No one knows how much of the article he produces is coming onto the market or how much will be wanted, no one knows whether his individual product will meet a real need, whether he will cover his costs or even be able to sell it at all. Anarchy of social production prevails.
* 'But like all other forms of production, commodity production has its own peculiar laws, which are inherent in and inseparable from it; and these laws assert themselves despite anarchy, in and through anarchy. They are manifested in the only persistent form of the social nexus, in exchange, and impose themselves on the individual producers as compulsory laws of competition. At first, therefore, they are unknown to these producers themselves and have to be discovered by them gradually, only through long experience. Thus they assert themselves without the producers and against the producers, as the natural laws of their form of production, working blindly. The product dominates the producers.
* 'In mediaeval society, especially in the earlier centuries, production was essentially for the producer’s own use. In the main it only satisfied the wants of the producer and his family. Where personal relations of dependence existed as in the countryside, it also contributed towards satisfying the wants of the feudal lord. No exchange was involved here, and consequently the products did not assume the character of commodities. The peasant family produced almost everything it required--utensils and clothing as well as food.' p.70
