## Chapter 1
* p. 39. Two main ideas: (1) class antagonism between proprietors and non-proprieters and (2) 'anarchy in production'.
* Examples of forerunners to 19th century prol: "(1) the Anabaptists and Thomas Munzer during the Reformation and Peasant's War; (2) the True Levellers and egalitarian Diggers during the English Revolution of 1650s; and (3) Gracchus Babeuf and the Conspiracy of Equals during the French Revolution." p.40-41
* Introduction to Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen on p. 41, details on their works from p. 43.
* '...the French philosophers [of the 1700s] appealed to reason as the sole judge of everything...But when the French Revolution had realized this rational society and state, the new order of things, however rational as compared with earlier conditions, proved to be by no means absolutely rational. The state based upon reason completely collapsed. Rousseau’s social contract had found its realization in the Reign of Terror, from which the bourgeoisie, after losing faith in its own political capacity, had taken refuge first in the corruption of the Directorate and finally under the wing of the Napoleonic despotism. The promised eternal peace was turned into an endless war of conquest. The society based upon reason had fared no better.' p.42 
* For small capitalists and peasants, the 'freedom of property' turned out to just be 'freedom from property' as they were forced to sell whatever they had under 'overpowering competition [from] big capital and big landed property.' p.42
 
### Saint-Simon, p.45
* Saint-Simon: antagonism is between 'workers' vs. 'idlers'. 'The idlers were not merely the old privileged persons, but all who lived on their incomes without taking any part in production or distribution. The “workers” were not only the wage-workers but also the manufacturers, the merchants, the bankers.' p. 45
* Who then was to lead? 'According to Saint-Simon, science and industry, both united by a new religious bond destined to restore that unity of religious ideas which had been broken since the Reformation—a necessarily mystical and rigidly hierarchical “new Christianity”. But science was the scholars; and industry was, in the first place, the active bourgeois, manufacturers, merchants, bankers.' p. 45
* F: '...to recognize the French Revolution as a...struggle and not simply as one between nobility and bourgeoisie, but *between nobility, bourgeoisie, and those without any property, was*, in the year 1802, a discovery of the greatest genius." 

### Fourier p.46
* Fourier 'mercilessly lays bare the material and moral misery of the bourgeois world'. Great satirist and 'the first to declare that in any given society the degree of women's emancipation i the natural measure of the general emancipation.' p.46
* Four stages of development for society:  (1) savagery, (2) patriarchy, (3) barbarism,(4) bourgeois society. p.47
* Fourier 'shows that “the civilized order gives every vice practised by barbarism in a simple fashion a complex, ambiguous, equivocal, hypocritical form”; that civilization moves in “a vicious circle”, in contradictions which it constantly reproduces without being able to solve, so that it constantly attains the opposite of what it wants to achieve, or pretends it wants to achieve. So that, for example, “under civilization poverty is born of abundance itself"'. p.48
