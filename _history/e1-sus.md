## Chapter 1
* p. 39. Two main ideas: (1) class antagonism between proprietors and non-proprieters and (2) 'anarchy in production'.
* Examples of forerunners to 19th century prol: "(1) the Anabaptists and Thomas Munzer during the Reformation and Peasant's War; (2) the True Levellers and egalitarian Diggers during the English Revolution of 1650s; and (3) Gracchus Babeuf and the Conspiracy of Equals during the French Revolution." p.40-41
* Introduction to Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen on p. 41, details on their works from p. 43.
* '...the French philosophers [of the 1700s] appealed to reason as the sole judge of everything...But when the French Revolution had realized this rational society and state, the new order of things, however rational as compared with earlier conditions, proved to be by no means absolutely rational. The state based upon reason completely collapsed. Rousseauâ€™s social contract had found its realization in the Reign of Terror, from which the bourgeoisie, after losing faith in its own political capacity, had taken refuge first in the corruption of the Directorate and finally under the wing of the Napoleonic despotism. The promised eternal peace was turned into an endless war of conquest. The society based upon reason had fared no better.' p.42 
* For small capitalists and peasants, the 'freedom of property' turned out to just be 'freedom from property' as they were forced to sell whatever they had under 'overpowering competition [from] big capital and big landed property.' p.42
