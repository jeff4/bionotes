## To do
* Reread from end of p.24 'The new starting-point was a compromise between teh rising middle class and the ex-feudal landwoners.

## Chapter 1
* p.39. Two main ideas: (1) class antagonism between proprietors and non-proprieters and (2) 'anarchy in production'.
* Examples of forerunners to 19th century prol: "(1) the Anabaptists and Thomas Munzer during the Reformation and Peasant's War; (2) the True Levellers and egalitarian Diggers during the English Revolution of 1650s; and (3) Gracchus Babeuf and the Conspiracy of Equals during the French Revolution." p.40-41
* Introduction to Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen on p.41, details on their works from p.43.
* '...the French philosophers [of the 1700s] appealed to reason as the sole judge of everything...But when the French Revolution had realized this rational society and state, the new order of things, however rational as compared with earlier conditions, proved to be by no means absolutely rational. The state based upon reason completely collapsed. Rousseau’s social contract had found its realization in the Reign of Terror, from which the bourgeoisie, after losing faith in its own political capacity, had taken refuge first in the corruption of the Directorate and finally under the wing of the Napoleonic despotism. The promised eternal peace was turned into an endless war of conquest. The society based upon reason had fared no better.' p.42 
* For small capitalists and peasants, the 'freedom of property' turned out to just be 'freedom from property' as they were forced to sell whatever they had under 'overpowering competition [from] big capital and big landed property.' p.42
 
### Saint-Simon, p. 45-46
* Saint-Simon: antagonism is between 'workers' vs. 'idlers'. 'The idlers were not merely the old privileged persons, but all who lived on their incomes without taking any part in production or distribution. The “workers” were not only the wage-workers but also the manufacturers, the merchants, the bankers.' p.45
* Who then was to lead? 'According to Saint-Simon, science and industry, both united by a new religious bond destined to restore that unity of religious ideas which had been broken since the Reformation—a necessarily mystical and rigidly hierarchical “new Christianity”. But science was the scholars; and industry was, in the first place, the active bourgeois, manufacturers, merchants, bankers.' p.45
* F: '...to recognize the French Revolution as a...struggle and not simply as one between nobility and bourgeoisie, but *between nobility, bourgeoisie, and those without any property, was*, in the year 1802, a discovery of the greatest genius." 

### Fourier p. 46-49
* Fourier 'mercilessly lays bare the material and moral misery of the bourgeois world'. Great satirist and 'the first to declare that in any given society the degree of women's emancipation i the natural measure of the general emancipation.' p.46
* Four stages of development for society:  (1) savagery, (2) patriarchy, (3) barbarism, (4) bourgeois society. p.47
* Fourier 'shows that **the civilized order gives every vice practised by barbarism in a simple fashion a complex, ambiguous, equivocal, hypocritical form**; that civilization moves in "a vicious circle", in contradictions which it constantly reproduces without being able to solve, so that it constantly attains the opposite of what it wants to achieve, or pretends it wants to achieve. So that, for example, *under civilization poverty is born of abundance itself*'. p.48
* Industrial Revolution in England in the 1700-mid-1800s. Rise of Modern Large Scale industry, 'revolutionizing the whole foundation of bourgeois society'. Formerly sedate pace of development turned into a storm of production. 'The division of society into big capitalists and propertyless proletarians went on with ever-increasing rapidity; between these, instead of the former stable middle estate, an unstable mass of artisans and small shopkeepers, which constituted the most fluctuating section of the population, now led a precarious existence.' p.48 
* Even though this was still the nascent stage of industrial acceleration, it was already 'producing crying social abuses—the herding together of a homeless population in the worst quarters of the large towns; the dissolution of all traditional bonds of descent, of patriarchal subordination, of the family; overwork, especially of women and children, on an appalling scale; massive demoralization of the working class, suddenly flung into altogether new conditions, from the country into the town, from agriculture into industry, from stable conditions of existence into insecure ones changing from day to day.' p.48-49

### Robert Owen p. 49-52
* p.49-52 Discusses Owen's startling social and economic success with the cotton-spinning mill at New Lanark in Scotland from 1800-1829.
	* Grew it to 2500 inhabitants, invented schools for toddlers, paid workers full wages even when mill was stopped by external economic forces, limited working day to 10.5 hours at a time when competitors forced their workers to labor for 13-14 hours per day.
	* 'In spite of all this, Owen was not content. The existence he had contrived for his workers was, in his eyes, still far from being worthy of human beings. **"The people were slaves at my mercy."** The relatively favourable conditions in which he had placed them were still far from allowing an all-round rational development of the character and of the intellect, much less the free exercise of all their faculties.' p.50.
	* 2500 persons were creating as much real wealth daily as a population of 600,000 did merely 50 years earlier. 'I asked myself what became of the difference between the wealth consumed by 2,500 persons and that which would have been consumed by 600,000?' p.50
	* The answer was profits to the owners, despite the fact that factories like his are what saved England from Napoleon. 
	* Owen drew up a practical, detailed plan to reconstruct things in an even better way.
* But this all changed when he began wanting to do more than simple philanthropy. 
* 'As long as he was simply a philanthropist, he was rewarded with nothing but wealth, applause, honour, and glory. He was the most popular man in Europe. Not only men of his own class, but statesmen and princes listened to him approvingly. **But when he came out with his communist theories, it was quite a different story.**' p.51
* 'Banished from official society, with a conspiracy of silence against him in the press, and ruined by his unsuccessful communist experiments in America in which he sacrificed all his fortune, he turned directly to the working class and continued working in their midst for thirty years.' p.51
* 'Every social movement, every real advance in England on behalf of the workers is linked with Owen’s name.' p.51
