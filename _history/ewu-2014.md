## Introduction: Imperatives of Asian American Citizenship
* p. 1: "In December, 1970, *The New York Times* published a front-page article declaring Japanese and Chinese in the US as 'an American success story.'
	* "In interviews with dozens of Asian Americans, the *Times* heard little of discrimination in housing, education and the realm of interpersonal interactions.
	* "Southerners even considered Asians to be white.
	* "By and large, Japanese and Chinese Americans no longer faced 'artificial barriers' to high-status professions. Whereas most of the previous generation had had no choice but to toil in menial service work such as laundering and gardening, stars of Asian America's current cohort had achieved nationally distiguished careers...
	* "The *Times* said: 'The pig-tailed coolie has been replaced in the imagination of many Americans by the earnest, bespectacled young scholar.'"

## Glossary
*  **WRA** - War Relocation Authority, a subdepartment of the Dept of Interior administering the internment camps of Japanese Americans (p. 12)
* **CRC** - Chicago Resettlement Committee. (p. 36)
* **SAC** -  Social Analysis Committee, subdivision of the CRA, (p. 36)

## Chapter 1: Leave Your Zoot Suits Behind
* Discussion of *yogore*, derived from *yogoreru* aka "to get dirty". (p. 18)
* Ralph Ellison in 1943: 'Perhaps the zoot suit conceals profound political meaning.' Though Ellison "had African American hipsters in mind, his meditation is apropos for pondering the contests over Japanese American citizenship that unfolded in the realm of the everyday during the war."

### Push and pull of assimilation in Chicago
* Assimilationist elites and leaders in Chicago were concerned that "visible ethnic Japanese congregations [in Chicago] might reinvigorate fears of the enemy Jap that the WRA, some of the Nikkei elite, and many ordinatry Japanese Americans had tried to extinguish through Nisei military service." (p. 34)
	* "To counter these setbacks, resettlement coordinators amplified their efforts to impress the importance to resettlers of 'accepting the responsibilities of citizenship in the American pattern.'"
	* Newcomers' Cooperative Committee had volunteers host "inter-racial parties". Various agencies and organizations like Chicago-area YMCAs, YWCAs, and the Chicago Public Parks and Recreation recruited Japanese resettlers to their programs and facilities. (p. 34)
	* "The Chicago Church Federation's United Ministry to Resettlers emphasized the imperative to 'avoid segregation *at all costs*' and advised resettlers to 'spread out thinly'."
	* "While these agencies understood their role in resettlement to be the facilitators of integration, they placed the onus of assimilation on Nisei themselves. This perspective was evident in their definition of segregation, which they considered to be entirely voluntary o the part of Japanese Americans, rather than a consequence of racial discrimination, the anguish of internment, and uncertainty over Nisei's collective postwar citizenship status." (p. 34)
* "Despite [the above assimilationist] undertakings, Nisei continued to seek out each other for companionship. Gradually, resettlement coordinators began to accept the situation." (p. 34)
