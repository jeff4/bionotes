### General notes
* p. 1: "In December, 1970, *The New York Times* published a front-page article declaring Japanese and Chinese in the US as 'an American success story.'
	* "In interviews with dozens of Asian Americans, the *Times* heard little of discrimination in housing, education and the realm of interpersonal interactions.
	* "Southerners even considered Asians to be white.
	* "By and large, Japanese and Chinese Americans no longer faced 'artificial barriers' to high-status professions. Whereas most of the previous generation had had no choice but to toil in menial service work such as laundering and gardening, stars of Asian America's current cohort had achieved nationally distiguished careers...
	* "The *Times* said: 'The pig-tailed coolie has been replaced in the imagination of many Americans by the earnest, bespectacled young scholar.'"
