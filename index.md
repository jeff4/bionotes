* Life, The Science of Biology (Tenth Edition, 2014) by Sadava, Hillis, Heller, and Berenbaum
* Review of electron orbitals p. 25 (Chapter 2.1: How does Atomic Structure Explain the Properties of Matter?).
	* See also [this Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_shell)
	* Remember:
		* First Shell: *1s^2* = total of **2 electrons** in this shell.
		* Second Shell: *2s^2 + 2p^6* = total of **8 electrons** in this shell.
		* Third Shell: *3s^2 + 3p^6 + 3d^10* = total of **18 electrons** in this shell.
		* Fourth Shell: *4s^2 + 4p^6 + 4d^10 + 4f^14* = total of **32 electrons** in this shell.
		* Fifth Shell: *5s^2 + 5p^6 + 5d^10 + 5f^14 + 5g^18* = total of **50 electrons** in this shell.
	* Filling order is based on [the Aufbau principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufbau_principle) aka the [Madelung energy ordering rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufbau_principle#Madelung_energy_ordering_rule):
		* 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p, 8s, etc.



### Notes on various versions of Intro Bio course at MIT 7.01

[Fundamentals of Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/syllabus/) was designed specifically for independent study and OpenCourseWare. It draws upon material developed for the three versions of MIT's Introductory Biology classes known as 7.012, 7.013, and 7.014. All three classes cover the same core material, which includes the fundamental principles of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology. In addition, each version of the subject has its own distinctive material.

According to [this page](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/), these courses were recorded in the following years

* [Fall, 2004](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/index.htm) - **7.012** with Professors Eric Lander and Robert Weinberg, focuses on genomics, neurobiology, and cancer cell biology.  
* **7.013** with Professors Hazel Sive and Tyler Jacks, focuses on development and cancer cell biology has been recorded twice:
	* [Spring 2018](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-013-introductory-biology-spring-2018/)  *(The Savada 10th Ed textbook I have is for this version of 7.013)*
	* [Spring 2013](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-013-introductory-biology-spring-2013/) 
* [Spring, 2005](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-014-introductory-biology-spring-2005/) - **7.014**, with Professors Graham Walker and Penny Chisholm, focuses on ecology and environment.
