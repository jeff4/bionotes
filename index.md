## Chapter 2: Review of [General Chemistry](/general-chemistry/)

### Section 2.1: How does Atomic Structure Explain the Properties of Matter?
* Review of [atomic orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_shell) p. 24-25 
	* An atomic orbital can hold at most two electrons.
	* Remember:
		* First Shell: *1s<sup>2</sup>* = total of **2 electrons** in this shell. Only an s-orbital shape and 1 orbital.
		* Second Shell: *2s<sup>2</sup> + 2p<sup>6</sup>* = total of **8 electrons** in this shell. Two subshells. The *s* subshell has one spherical orbital in it. The *p* subshell has 3 dumbbell-shaped orbitals. Thus there are a total of 4 orbitals.
		* Third Shell: *3s<sup>2</sup> + 3p<sup>6</sup> + 3d<sup>10</sup>* = total of **18 electrons** in this shell. Three subshells: s, p, d. As expected, the s subshell contains one s orbital. The p subshell contains 3 p orbitals. The d subshell has 5 d orbitals. 1+3+5= **9 orbitals** which collectively hold a maximum of 18 electrons.
		* Fourth Shell: *4s<sup>2</sup> + 4p<sup>6</sup> + 4d<sup>10</sup> + 4f<sup>14</sup>* = total of **32 electrons** in this shell. 1+3+5+7 = **16 orbitals** which can hold a maximum of 32 electrons  
		* Fifth Shell: *5s<sup>2</sup> + 5p<sup>6</sup> + 5d<sup>10</sup> + 5f<sup>14</sup> + 5g<sup>18</sup>* = total of **50 electrons** in this shell.
	* Filling order is based on [the Aufbau principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufbau_principle) aka the [Madelung energy ordering rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufbau_principle#Madelung_energy_ordering_rule):
		* 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p, 8s, etc.

### Table 2.1 Chemical Bonds - p. 26

| Type of Bond              | Description                                                         | Bond Energy (kcal/mol) |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Covalent bond             | Sharing of electron pairs                                           | 50-110                 |
| Ionic bond          | Example NaCl — electrons stolen to complete octets in valence shell to produce *+cations* and *-anions*   | 3-7                    |
| Hydrogen bond             | Attraction between bonded H<sup>+</sup> atom and electronegative atom. Important for [secondary structure within a protein molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_secondary_structure) but also occurs between molecules   | 3-7                    |
| Hydrophobic interaction   | Nonpolar substances in presence of water (or other polar substrate) | 1-2                    |
| van der Waals interaction | Interaction of electrons of nonpolar substances                     | 1                      |


### Concept of Electronegativity - p. 28
* When two atoms of different elements are covalently bonded in a molecule, their electrons are not equally shared. So one of the positively charged nuclei may exert a greater attractive force on the shared electron pair than the other nucleus. This attractive force is called **electronegativity**.
* p. 28: atoms with similar electronegativity = **nonpolar covalent bond**. Atoms with different electronegativity produce a **polar covalent bond**.
* Extreme electronegativity = powerful positive proton nuclues which leads to ability to attract greater than "fair share" of shared electrons in a molecule
* Maps to having almost having enough electrons in valencce shell to complete s2p6 octet
* In general, most electronegative columns in the periodic table are Groups 16 & 17 because they have 6 & 7 electrons, respectively in their outer valence shell.
* Conversely, the least electronegative groups in the periodic table are Groups 1 & 2 which respectively have 1 & 2 electrons in their outermost shell and these are the easiest electrons to lose.
* At the limit, when superstrong-electronegative and superweakly-electronegative elements interact, they don't just form a hyper-polar covalent bond; instead actually turn into an Ionic Bond.
* good illustration of this in **MSJ** p. 288, Figure 8.5.
### Ionic Bonds - p. 28-29
* When 2 interacting atoms have a large enough difference in electronegativity, ions form as the more powerfully electronegative nucleus strips electrons away from the weakly electronegative (aka positive atom). 
* Example of sodium Na and chlorine Cl
	* Na has its 1st two shells filled (aka *1s<sup>2</sup>* + *2s<sup>2</sup> + 2p<sup>6</sup>*). Also, as a [Group I element](https://iupac.org/what-we-do/periodic-table-of-elements/), it also has an extra electron in the next subshell: 3s<sup>2</sup> aka the first electron to appear in Shell M. It is easy to lose this electron.
	* Meanwhile, Cl only has 7 electrons in its  *3s<sup>2</sup> + 3p<sup>6</sup>* subshells. But ideally it would "like" **8 electrons** to complete subshell *3p<sup>6</sup>*. 
	* So in solution, Cl's more electronegative (aka more positive) nucleus "steals" the sole electron in Na's outermost subshell 3s<sup>2</sup>.
	* This produces a **positive cation** Na<sup>+</sup> and a **negative anion**  Cl<sup>-</sup> .
* This also explains the octet rule for molecules formed by atoms where *s<sup>2</sup> and p<sup>6</sup>* subshells are concerned.

### Hydrogen bonds
* Salts and interactions with polar molecules - p. 29
* Good interactive page on [hemoglobin and primary, secondary, tertiary, and quartenary structure](https://www.labxchange.org/library/items/lb:LabXchange:99c39c9f:lx_simulation:1)

### Section 2.4: H<sub>2</sub>0 has special properties - p. 32-34
* **Electronegativity causes strongly polar covalent bonds.** Water has a tetrahedral shape with oxygen in the center, two of the tetrahedral vertices occupied by hydrogen atoms, and the two remaining vertices occupied by an unbonded electron pair. Because oxygen has a high electronegativity relative to hydrogen, there is a  partial *delta-positive* charge on each hydrogen. Conversely, there is a partial *delta-negative* charge on each unbonded electron pair on the other two vertices. 
* Highly polar bonds then cause multiple and powerful hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Can also refer to these hydrogen bonds as intermolecular forces.
	* In a liquid state, water molecules are connected to each other by chains of powerful but intermittent hydrogen bonds. Special properties of liquid water thanks to multiple strings of hydrogen bonds:
		* High surface tension
		* High cohesion (water to water) and high adhesion (water to other substances) which are critical to [upward water flow in plant xylem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylem#Main_function_–_upwards_water_transport) 
		* High surface tension (water striders) and allows beads of water droplets (ants carrying a ball of water)
		* Lower vapor pressure (aka evaporation)
		* High specific heat
		* High boiling point aka heat of vaporization
	* When water freezes and turns into a solid, the daisy chain of randomly appearing/disappearing hydrogen bonds form into more permanent hydrogen bonds. These new hydrogen bonds follow from the partial delta-charges; the result is a  "hollow" crystal structure for ice which is why is less dense than liquid water. Each water molecule is connected to [4 other water molecules in a 3-d tetrahedral structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxCnDJSE1ck&t=157s). 

### Review of Acids, Bases, and Buffers - p. 33-36


## Chapter 3: Macromolecules I - Proteins, Carbohydrates, Lipids (p. 39-61)
* Four kinds of macromolecules: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids
* Macromolecular polymers are made of different types of monomers:
	* Proteins are made up of **amino acid** monomers.
	* Carbohydrates are made up of simple **sugar** monomers.
	* Lipids are made up of lipid monomers connected by *noncovalent bonds*
* In general, only polymers with molecular weights > 1000 are considered macromolecules.
* Figure 3.1 (p. 40) has a good diagram of various functional groups, categories of compounds, and example compounds.
* Figure 3.3 (p. 41) has good % breakdown of macromolecules in living tissue.
* Reactants Monomer<sub>1</sub> + ... + Monomer<sub>n</sub> --> Polymer via removal of H<sub>2</sub>0 and addition of energy (endothermic reaction). Also called **condensation** or **dehydration reaction**.
* Reverse reaction of Reactant Polymer ---> breaking into smaller monomers by adding water and releasing energy from the reactant  (exothermic reaction). Called **hydrolysis**.

### Proteins
* The protein alphabet of monomers cosists of 20 amino acids. All proteins consist of a permutation of these 20 elemental units. 
	* The smaller limit of proteins is around **51 amino acids** for *[insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin)* with molecular weight of 5,733.
	* The upper limit of protein chain size is around **27,000 amino acid** for the muscle protein *[titin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titin)* with a molecular weight of almost 3 million.
* Polypeptide chains are linear (*aka* unbranched) sequences of covalently linked amino acids.
* Amino acids have 3 functional groups plus 1 hydrogen surrounding the central *&#945;*-carbon:
	1. **carboxyl functional group** -COOH ionizes to -COO<sup>-</sup>
	1.  **amine group** -NH<sub>2</sub> ionizes to -NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>
	1. **R side chain**
* Amino acids can appear as optical isomers with **D- for righthand** and **L- for lefthand** configurations. (d-amino acids for the Latin *dextro*; l-amino acids for the Latin *levo*). Only L- configurations appear in nature / are used by living cells with the [rare exception of some structural proteins used in bacterial cell walls](http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/bioprop/landd.html).
* See Table 3.2 on p. 44 for good categorization of 20 amino acids based on R side chains.
* Amino acids are combined using a condensation / dehydration reaction that forms a **peptide linkage**. The N- terminus all the way on the left of the protein is by considered the "beginning" of the sentence and the C- terminus all the way at the right end is considered the "end" of the protein "sentence".
* Primary structure is the sequence of repeating -N-C-C-N-C-C-
* Good diagram of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quartenary structure on p. 46.
* Each monomer is an amino acid. A short sequence of amino acids is called a **peptide**. Multiple peptides together form polypeptides and protein subunits.
* Concept of [molecular chaperones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_(protein)) which help guide proper folding of proteins directly after peptide synthesis or after denaturation to refold. Cancer cells produce chaperones to help secure proper folding for cancer-promoting proteins (p. 51). See p. 51 also for example of HSP60 cage + lid.

#### Secondary structure of proteins
* *&#945;*-helices are right-handed and the R-groups extend outward from the central axis of the -N-C-C-N-C-C- chain in a steady spiral. Coiling results from the hydrogen bonding between the small &#948;<sup>+</sup> of the H<sup>+</sup> on the N and the &#948;<sup>-</sup> on the carbonyl oxygen C=O of another amino acid in the chain.
* Pleated  *&#946;*-sheets

#### Tertiary structure of proteins
* Definitive 3D structure of a protein, which usually includes a polar (hydrophilic) exterior region and nonpolar (hydrophobic) interior where reactions happen.
* &#945;-helices and  &#946; pleatedsheets secondary structures are determined by hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, tertiary structure is caused by nonovalent interactions between the **various -R side chains functional groups** hanging off the central polypeptide -N-C-C-N-C-C- . Examples:
	* Covalent disulfide bridges
	* Hydrogen bonds between side chains
	* Hydrophobic side chains an aggregate together in the interior of the protein. These close interactions are stabilized by van der Waals forces.
	* Ionic bonds can form salt bridges between positively and negatively charged side chains.
* p. 48 interesting example of how [Christian Anfinsen used ribonuclease A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfinsen%27s_dogma) to prove that primary structure contains all the info needed to determine tertiary structure.

#### Quartenary structure
* When a protein consists of two or more polypeptides, called **subunits**, each of these subunits fold into their own tertiary structure.
* The interaction of these subunits is the **quartenary structure**.

#### Proteins and associated functions - p.42

### Carbohydrates - p. 51
* Usually have the generic formula C<sub>m</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>O<sub>n</sub> where m,n &#8712; {positive integers}.
* Carbohydrates have important roles in energy storage/transport and structure like cellulose in plants. 
* *Chemically modified carbohydrates* also play critical structural roles in biology:  
	* **galactosamine** is a major part of cartilage (p. 55)
	* a derivative of **glucosamine** is a component of chitin which is important in arthropods and fungi.
* Four categories of carbohydrates based on number of monomers:
	1. **Monosaccharides** like glucose
	1. **Disaccharides** like sucrose, a combination of glucose and fructose
	1. **Oligosaccharides** are made up of about 3-20 monosaccharides
	1. **Polysaccharides** are made up of hundreds or thousands of monosaccharides. Examples: starch, glycogen, cellulose.

#### Monosaccharides
* In living systems, most monosaccharides are the dextro- / D- / (right-handed) optical isomer.
* *Pentoses* are five-carbon sugars, including [ribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribose) which is part of the sugar-phosphate backbone of RNA and [deoxyribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose) which forms the sugar-phosphate backbane of DNA.  
* *Hexoses* are 6-carbon sugars such as glucose, fructose, mannose, and galactose.
	* **Glucose** are 6-carbon sugars that can take the form of straight carbon chains or rings in chair configuration. The ring consists of 5 carbons and an oxygen; the 6th carbon hangs off of the ring at the 5-carbon.
	* Glucose comes in [both &#945;- and &#946;-isomers](https://www.worldofmolecules.com/3D/what-is-the-difference-between-alpha-and-beta-glucose.html) which convert to each other readily in aqeous solution and are in equilibrium.
* Dehydration synthesis reactions connects monosaccharides into disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides via [glycosidic linkages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosidic_bond)

#### Polysaccharides
* Whereas all proteins are linear chains of amino acids, monosaccharides can bond in many branching ways to form polysaccharides.
* **Starches** are polysaccharides which are often [branched](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Polysaccharides) made up of glucose monomers via with &#945;-glycosidic linkages. 
	* These branches attach from the via 1-&#945; carbon of glucose monomer A to either the 4 or 6 carbon on the glucose molecule B.
	* Starch is the primary energy storage for plants. Some plant starches are unbranched like [amylose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylose) which can consist of 300-3000 (or even more) monomeric glucoses.
* **Glycogen** is highly branched and used in animals. 
	* Similarly to starch for plants, glycogen acts as an energy store for animals in the liver and in the muscles. 
	* The branches occur every 10-14 glucose monomers between the carbon 6 of the main branch and the 1-&#945; carbon of the branched glucose. See this [Wiki link on the brancher enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_branching_enzyme#Function) for more.
	* Unlike glucose which is readily soluble in water, glycogen is nonpolar and thus does not dissolve in water which relieve osmotic pressure in animal cells allowing more compact storage. 
* **Cellulose** is a critical componet of plant cell walls. Connected via glycosidic linkages at the 1-&#946; carbon (instead of the 1-&#945; carbon seen in starch and glycogen). This makes it much harder to break down cellulose.
* Chemically modified carbs which have undergone redox reactions and/or had functional groups like phosphate, amino, or N-acteyl gropus added. Cartilage and chitin.
* Also refer to carbohydrate panels in Alberts 5th, p. 112-113.

### Lipids and phospholipids - p. 56
* Types of lipids
	* Fats and oils (triglycerides) store energy.
	* Phosopholipids provide structure to membranes.
	* Carotenoids and chlorophylls capture light energy for plants.
	* Steroids and modified fatty acids play regulatory roles as hormones as vitamins.
	* Fat in animals provides thermal insulation
	* Myelin (fatty sheath) surrounding neuronal axons provide electrical insulation to speed the action potential.
	* Oil and wax on the surface of skin and leaves helps repel water and prevents excess evaporation.
* Simple lipids like fats and oils consist of **triglycerides**. 
	* A triglyceride typically combines an alcohol (like glyceryl with 3 -OH hydroxyl groups) with three fatty acids which are simply long chains of hydrocarbons. 
	* The glycerol and fatty acids are bonded by 3 dehydration/condensation synthesis reactions that yield 3 water molecules.
	* The resulting bonds are ester linkages with a central oxygen between each fatty acid and the glycerol molecule.
	* Saturated fatty acid = full of hydrogen atoms, no double bonding
	* Unsaturated fatty acid = some missing hydrogen atoms *aka* some double or triple bonding somewhere.
* **Phospholipids** are amphipathic; have a polar phosphate end and a nonpolar hydrocarbon chain end.
* **Carotenoids** are a family of light-absorbing pigments found in plants and animals. &#946;-carotene aka betacarotene is part of the photosynthesis process for plants. Meanwhile, betacarotine breaks down to two vitamin A molecules for humans as part of the visual system.
* **Steroids** are multiply linked rings of hydrocarbons that are important as membrane components as well as signals in the hormone system.
* **Vitamins** A, D, E, and K are lipids, aka they are fat soluble.
* **Waxes** are hydrophobic and at room temperature, malleable/plastic. Each wax molecule sonists of a saturated long-chain fatty acid connected via an ester linkage to a long-chain alochol. As such, they have between 40-60 CH<sub>2</sub> groups.
* Lipid panels on Alberts 5th Ed, 114-115
	* Stearic acid (C18) and palmitic acid (c16) are saturated aka full of hydrogens and only carbon single bonds.
	* Oleic acid (C18) is unsaturated with a single double bond between C9 and C10.
	* Glycerol is a 3-carbon alcohol with an -OH hydroxyl attached to C1, C2, and C3 respectively. It serves as the backbone for triglycerides when 3 fatty acids attach via dehydration/condensation synthesis at the ester linkage.
	* Carboxyl groups -COOH give rise to: (a) ionized form -COO<sup>-</sup>, (b) esters, (c) amides.
	* Phospholipids where one of the 3 fatty acids attached to the glycerol backbone is replaced by a hydrophilic  **phosphate group -PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>** . Thus forming a hydrophilic head and 2 hydrophobic tails. 
	* The phosophate group can also attach to other moeities, such as choline in the example of [phosphatidylcholine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylcholine).
	* Isoprene units like [2-methyl-1,3 butadiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprene)

# Notes on MIT 7.00x at EdX
* *Course started: July 14, 2020*

## Lecture 1: Introduction and the Biochemistry of Life
* Seems like intro lectures by Eric Lander were recorded in the fall of 2012, because he references this [NYT Sunday Magazine article on pain](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/magazine/ashlyn-blocker-feels-no-pain.html) and [this drug for cystic fibrosis](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/01/business/fda-approves-cystic-fibrosis-drug.html). Also, he refers to an early lecture earlier that morning at the Broad Institute (probably by [Feng Zhang](https://www.broadinstitute.org/what-broad/areas-focus/project-spotlight/crispr-timeline) or a close collaborator) about work that was not yet published and about new developments in applying CRISPR/Cas9 to precisely edit DNA in mammalian systems.
* Timeline
	* **4.5 billion** years ago: Earth formed
	* **4.0 B** ya: Earth cooled enough for life
	* **3.7 B** ya: first evidence of prokaryotic life
	* **1.5 B** ya: first eukaryotic life with nucleus
	* **500 mya**: first multicellular life just prior to Cambrian Explosion
	* **5 mya**: first hominids aka Australopithecina or Hominina subtribe within the Hominidae Family.
	* **100,000 ya**: first homo sapiens
	* 1861 AD: MIT founded
* Fundamental principles and intellectual unification of biology
	* Biochemistry in ~1900: purification and analysis of unique proteins, nucleic acids, etc.
	* Genetics in ~1900: Organism minus one component, aka mutant. This component which they called a gene.
	* 1953: structure of DNA discovered by Watson & Crick, combining the two streams of biochem and genetics into the new unified science of **molecular biology**.
	* 1970s: Invention of **recombinant DNA** to isolate specific gene, read what protein it encodes. Take a protein and decide which gene codes for it.
	* 1980s: How do we map the genes that map to specific disease? Rather than studying single genes in isolation, was it possible to study all the genes for an organism at once? Yes, the beginning of **genomics**.

## Lecture 2: Biochemistry
* Eduard Buchner and the founding of biochemistry. 
	* During a [series of experimnts from 1857-1877](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation#History_of_the_use_of_fermentation), Louis Pasteur proved that microorganisms were involved in fermentation (conversion of juice into CO<sub>2</sub> and alcohol). This seemed to be a defense of vitalism.
	* However, [in 1897](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Buchner#Research), Buchner showed that if one took a mass of yeast and crushed all the living cells to death, one could extract dead "yeast juice" that could still perform fermentation. This showed that a nonliving enzyme ([zymaseproduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zymase)) by yeast was responsible for fermentation. 
* Composition of cells; covalent bonds
	* Atomic composition of human life: Consists largely of 63% H, 24% O, 10% C, 14% N, 0.2% phosphorus,  and less than 0.1% sulfur.
	* Molecular composition of human life measured by dry weight: 80% H<sub>2</sub>O. The remaining 20% can be subdivided into:
		* 50% protein
		* 15% carbohydrate
		* 15% nucleic acids
		* 10% lipids and fats
	* Covalent bonds. Number of bonds formed for an octet satisifed atom: **H1**, **C4**, **N3**, **P5**, **S2**, **O2**.
* Noncovalent bonds, including hydrogen bonds (5 kcal/mol), ionic bonds, Van Der Waals forces
* Lipids and phospholipids
	* Oil and water don't mix b/c the polar water gets "offended" by the nonpolar interlopers interrupting the "desired" hydrogen bonding between water molecules
	* A nonpolar hydrocarbon (like cyclohexane C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>) can be turned polar by converting them to:
		* Alcohols have a hydroxl -OH group attached.
		* Carboxylic Acids contain one or more -COOH groups.
	*  Fatty acids are a type of carboxylic acid. If you attach 3 of them to an alcolhol like glycerol, we create a "Tri-acyl-glyceride", aka triglyceride. This is a lipid
	* Lipids are [amphipathic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiphile) with a hydrophlic head and hydrophobic tail.
	* When placed in a polar solvent like water, lipids spontaneously form globular structures like [micelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micelle) (monolayer with hydrophilic heads out, tails in) or [liposomes (bilayered)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome). See also <a Href="https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Biochemistry/Book%3A_Biochemistry_Online_(Jakubowski)/01%3A_LIPID_STRUCTURE/1.2%3A_Lipids_in_Water/1.2A%3A_Micelles_and_Bilayers">this page</a>
* ATP - adenosine triphosophate
* Carbohydrates
	* glucose = monosaccharide. Can form disaccharides, polysaccharides, etc.
* Remember, here are the types of forces that Lander emphasizes:
	1. **Ionic Bonds**
	2. **Covalent Bonds** (polar like O-H, N-H, C=O, vs. nonpolar like C-H, C-C, C=C, etc.)
	3. **Hydrogen Bonds** (O----H---O,  N----H---O ,  etc.)
	4. **Hydrophobic forces** that force hydrophobic molecules together, so that the liquid H<sub>2</sub>O molecules around them can form hydrogen bonds easily "as desired". 
	1. **Van Der Waals Forces** which are temporary charges that can add up to a lot, e.g,  geckos use these to climb walls

# Molecular Biology of the Cell
* Albert et al., Fifth Edition (2008)
* p. 20 - defintion of **homologs**: All related genes that result from duplication 
	* Duplicate genes that are conserved in two branches after speciation are called **orthologs**
	* Duplicate genes within a single genome are **paralogs**
	* Orthologs and paralogs are subsets of the larger containing set of homologs

## Different versions of Intro Bio course at MIT

There is a special version of the MIT intro bio course that was optimized for EdX called [7.00x, Introduction to Biology - The Secret of Life](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-biology-the-secret-of-life-3) taught by Langer. Current lectures seem to have been recorded in 2012 with updates etc. ~2015.

Separately, [7.01 Fundamentals of Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/syllabus/) was designed specifically for OpenCourseWare. It draws upon material developed for the three versions of MIT's Introductory Biology classes known as 7.012, 7.013, and 7.014. All three classes cover the same core material, which includes the fundamental principles of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology. In addition, each version of the subject has its own distinctive material.

According to [this page](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/), these versions of 7.01 were recorded in the following years:

* [Fall, 2004](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/index.htm) - **7.012** with Professors Eric Lander and Robert Weinberg, focuses on genomics, neurobiology, and cancer cell biology.  
* [Spring, 2005](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-014-introductory-biology-spring-2005/) - **7.014**, with Professors Graham Walker and Penny Chisholm, focuses on ecology and environment.
* **7.013** with Professors Hazel Sive and Tyler Jacks, focuses on development and cancer cell biology has been recorded twice:
	* [Spring 2018](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-013-introductory-biology-spring-2018/)  *(The Savada 10th Ed textbook I have is for this version of 7.013)*
	* [Spring 2013](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-013-introductory-biology-spring-2013/)
