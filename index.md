	* **Homologous genes** are the superset. (p. 566) These are divided into: (a)  **orthologs** which have a common function among different organisms post-speciation;  (b) **paralogs** often have different functions but are the result of duplication and subsequent evolution and generally within same species; and (c) **xenologs** which are the result of LGT and so have evolved independently of the usual cellular line of descent.
