### December, 2020
* Started rereading  Valentine [*On the Origin of Phyla*](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo3616676.html) (2004)
* 12/06/2020: <del> First read through 2016 Booth, Mariscal, and Doolittle, [*The Modern Synthesis in Light of Microbial Genomics*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27482743/) </del>
* 12/06/2020: <del>1988 de Queiroz, [*Systematics and the Darwinian Revolution*](https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/4662) -- good diagrams illustrating monophyletic vs. paraphyletic vs. polyphyletic, and strict speciation ancestry vs. interbreeding ancestry (Fig. 4) </del>
* 12/07/2020: <del> 1988 de Queiroz and Donoghue, [*Phylogenetic Systematics and The Species Problem*](https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/4670) - interbreeding populations vs. monophyletic definitions </del>
* 12/09/2020: <del>2016 Etienne G.J. Danchin, [*Lateral gene transfer in eukaryotes: tip of the iceberg or of the ice cube?*](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-016-0330-x) suggests that minimal LGT has happened recently in Eukaryota. However, common not just within Archaea and Bacteria but *between* those two domains as well even in relatively recent times</del>
* 12/12/2020: <del>completed Sapp[*The New Foundations of Evolution: On the Tree of Life*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-new-foundations-of-evolution-9780195388503?cc=us&lang=en&) (2009)</del>
* 12/13/2020: <del>* 2007 Rose and Oakley, [*The New Biology: Beyond The Modern Synthesis*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18036242/). Excellent review of how 21st century biology is a reintegration on the order of Darwin in 1859, Modern Synthesis in mid-20th century. Also very helpful reviewers comments in the same PDF by [Doolitle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Doolittle) and [Eugene V. Koonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Koonin) esp. with regard to microbiology, bacterial LGT, etc. Also Koonin and authors debate how helpful it might be to call this new biology "Postmodern BIology".</del>
