## Chapters 2,3: Review of subatomic and chemical foundations, small molecules, macromolecules  - p. 21-61

### Chapter 2.1: How does Atomic Structure Explain the Properties of Matter?
* Review of [atomic orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_shell) p. 24-25 
	* An atomic orbital can hold at most two electrons.
	* Remember:
		* First Shell: *1s<sup>2</sup>* = total of **2 electrons** in this shell. Only an s-orbital shape and 1 orbital.
		* Second Shell: *2s<sup>2</sup> + 2p<sup>6</sup>* = total of **8 electrons** in this shell. Two subshells. The *s* subshell has one spherical orbital in it. The *p* subshell has 3 dumbbell-shaped orbitals. Thus there are a total of 4 orbitals.
		* Third Shell: *3s<sup>2</sup> + 3p<sup>6</sup> + 3d<sup>10</sup>* = total of **18 electrons** in this shell. Three subshells: s, p, d. As expected, the s subshell contains one s orbital. The p subshell contains 3 p orbitals. The d subshell has 5 d orbitals. 1+3+5= **9 orbitals** which collectively hold a maximum of 18 electrons.
		* Fourth Shell: *4s<sup>2</sup> + 4p<sup>6</sup> + 4d<sup>10</sup> + 4f<sup>14</sup>* = total of **32 electrons** in this shell. 1+3+5+7 = **16 orbitals** which can hold a maximum of 32 electrons  
		* Fifth Shell: *5s<sup>2</sup> + 5p<sup>6</sup> + 5d<sup>10</sup> + 5f<sup>14</sup> + 5g<sup>18</sup>* = total of **50 electrons** in this shell.
	* Filling order is based on [the Aufbau principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufbau_principle) aka the [Madelung energy ordering rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufbau_principle#Madelung_energy_ordering_rule):
		* 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p, 8s, etc.

### Table 2.1 Chemical Bonds - p. 26

| Type of Bond              | Description                                                         | Bond Energy (kcal/mol) |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Covalent bond             | Sharing of electron pairs                                           | 50-110                 |
| Ionic bond          | Example NaCl — electrons stolen to complete octets in valence shell to produce *+cations* and *-anions*   | 3-7                    |
| Hydrogen bond             | Attraction between bonded H<sup>+</sup> atom and electronegative atom. Important for [secondary structure within a protein molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_secondary_structure) but also occurs between molecules   | 3-7                    |
| Hydrophobic interaction   | Nonpolar substances in presence of water (or other polar substrate) | 1-2                    |
| van der Waals interaction | Interaction of electrons of nonpolar substances                     | 1                      |


### Concept of Electronegativity - p. 28
* When two atoms of different elements are covalently bonded in a molecule, their electrons are not equally shared. So one of the positively charged nuclei may exert a greater attractive force on the shared electron pair than the other nucleus. This attractive force is called **electronegativity**.
* p. 28: atoms with similar electronegativity = **nonpolar covalent bond**. Atoms with different electronegativity produce a **polar covalent bond**.
* Extreme electronegativity = powerful positive proton nuclues which leads to ability to attract greater than "fair share" of shared electrons in a molecule
* Maps to having almost having enough electrons in valencce shell to complete s2p6 octet
* In general, most electronegative columns in the periodic table are Groups 16 & 17 because they have 6 & 7 electrons, respectively in their outer valence shell.
* Conversely, the least electronegative groups in the periodic table are Groups 1 & 2 which respectively have 1 & 2 electrons in their outermost shell and these are the easiest electrons to lose.
* At the limit, when superstrong-electronegative and superweakly-electronegative elements interact, they don't just form a hyper-polar covalent bond; instead actually turn into an Ionic Bond.
* good illustration of this in **MSJ** p. 288, Figure 8.5.
### Ionic Bonds - p. 28-29
* When 2 interacting atoms have a large enough difference in electronegativity, ions form as the more powerfully electronegative nucleus strips electrons away from the weakly electronegative (aka positive atom). 
* Example of sodium Na and chlorine Cl
	* Na has its 1st two shells filled (aka *1s<sup>2</sup>* + *2s<sup>2</sup> + 2p<sup>6</sup>*). Also, as a [Group I element](https://iupac.org/what-we-do/periodic-table-of-elements/), it also has an extra electron in the next subshell: 3s<sup>2</sup> aka the first electron to appear in Shell M. It is easy to lose this electron.
	* Meanwhile, Cl only has 7 electrons in its  *3s<sup>2</sup> + 3p<sup>6</sup>* subshells. But ideally it would "like" **8 electrons** to complete subshell *3p<sup>6</sup>*. 
	* So in solution, Cl's more electronegative (aka more positive) nucleus "steals" the sole electron in Na's outermost subshell 3s<sup>2</sup>.
	* This produces a **positive cation** Na<sup>+</sup> and a **negative anion**  Cl<sup>-</sup> .
* This also explains the octet rule for molecules formed by atoms where *s<sup>2</sup> and p<sup>6</sup>* subshells are concerned.

### Hydrogen bonds
* Salts and interactions with polar molecules - p. 29
* Good interactive page on [hemoglobin and primary, secondary, tertiary, and quartenary structure](https://www.labxchange.org/library/items/lb:LabXchange:99c39c9f:lx_simulation:1)

### Chapter 2.4: H<sub>2</sub>0 has special properties - p. 32-34
* **Electronegativity causes strongly polar covalent bonds.** Water has a tetrahedral shape with oxygen in the center, two of the tetrahedral vertices occupied by hydrogen atoms, and the two remaining vertices occupied by an unbonded electron pair. Because oxygen has a high electronegativity relative to hydrogen, there is a  partial *delta-positive* charge on each hydrogen. Conversely, there is a partial *delta-negative* charge on each unbonded electron pair on the other two vertices. 
* Highly polar bonds then cause multiple and powerful hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Can also refer to these hydrogen bonds as intermolecular forces.
	* In a liquid state, water molecules are connected to each other by chains of powerful but intermittent hydrogen bonds. Special properties of liquid water thanks to multiple strings of hydrogen bonds:
		* High surface tension
		* High cohesion (water to water) and high adhesion (water to other substances) which are critical to [upward water flow in plant xylem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylem#Main_function_–_upwards_water_transport) 
		* High surface tension (water striders) and allows beads of water droplets (ants carrying a ball of water)
		* Lower vapor pressure (aka evaporation)
		* High specific heat
		* High boiling point aka heat of vaporization
	* When water freezes and turns into a solid, the daisy chain of randomly appearing/disappearing hydrogen bonds form into more permanent hydrogen bonds. These new hydrogen bonds follow from the partial delta-charges; the result is a  "hollow" crystal structure for ice which is why is less dense than liquid water. Each water molecule is connected to [4 other water molecules in a 3-d tetrahedral structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxCnDJSE1ck&t=157s).

## Chapter 7: Quantum Theory, Structure of Atom, Electron Configurations, Atomic Orbitals, and Consequences for Periodic Table Trends

### The Four Quantum Numbers: *n*, &#8467;,  *m<sub>&#8467;</sub>*, *m<sub>s</sub>* – **MSJ** Chapter 7.5, p. 237-242

* List of four quantum numbers is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_number#Electron_in_an_atom) and a general description of atomic orbitals is on [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital#Types_of_orbitals).

#### Principal quantum number "*n*"
* Values = {1, 2, 3, 4,...} *aka* which electron shell, principal energy level, or "size" of the electron orbital. See also [the wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_quantum_number).
* *n=1* has 1 subshell s with 2 electrons. 
* *n=2* has 2 subshells. *2s<sup>2</sup> + 2p<sup>6</sup>* = total of **8 electrons** in this shell.
* *n=3* has 3 subshells. *3s<sup>2</sup> + 3p<sup>6</sup> + 3d<sup>10</sup>* = total of **18 electrons** in this shell.
* Etc.

#### Azimuthal quantum number "&#8467;" aka subshell
* Specifies the [quantum number for an atomic orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuthal_quantum_number) which determines its orbital angular momentum as well as the **shape of the electron orbital**: s, p, d, f, g, etc...
* *&#8467;=0* = **subshell s**, maximum of 2 electrons. Spherical shape.
* *&#8467;=1* = **subshell p**, maximum of 6 electrons. Dumbell shapes, one for each axis: p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub>
* *&#8467;=2* = **subshell d**, maximum of 10 electrons. For shape, look at the third row of [this Wiki  image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spherical_Harmonics.png)
* *&#8467;=3* = **subshell f**, maximum of 14 electrons. For shape, look at the fourth row of [this Wiki  image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spherical_Harmonics.png)

#### Magnetic quantum number "*m<sub>&#8467;</sub>*"
* Values of *m<sub>&#8467;;</sub>* are dependent on the subshell / azimuthal quantum number *l* and describes the **orientation** of each atomic orbital "lobe". See sample values in the table in [this wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_quantum_number) or in MSJ p. 240, Table 7.3.
* For subshell s where *&#8467;=0*, there is only one value for *m<sub>&#8467;</sub>* which is *m<sub>&#8467;</sub>* = 0. Holds 2 electrons
* For subshell p where *&#8467;=1*, there are 3 possible values for *m<sub>&#8467;</sub>* which is *m<sub>&#8467;</sub>* = {-1,0,+1}. Holds 6 electrons.
* For subshell d where *&#8467;=2*, there are 5 possible values for *m<sub>&#8467;</sub>* which is *m<sub>&#8467;</sub>* = {-2,-1,0,+1,+1,+2}. Holds 10 electrons.
* For subshell f where *&#8467;=3*, there are 7 possible values for *m<sub>&#8467;</sub>* which is *m<sub>&#8467;</sub>* = {-3,-2,-1,0,+1,+1,+2,+3}. Holds 14 electrons.

#### Spin quantum number "*m<sub>s</sub>*"
* Describes the [spin of an electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_quantum_number), values of +1/2 or -1/2, and at most two electrons can occupy an atomic orbital. If they are paired, then the electrons must have opposite spin. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_number#Electron_in_an_atom) uses the variable name *s* for spin quantum number but textbooks and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/quantum-physics/quantum-numbers-and-orbitals/v/quantum-numbers) use the m<sub>s</sub> notation instead.

### Periodic Table Trends
* Chapter 7, sections 7.9 - 7.12, p. 254 - 269
* Examples of trends across periodic table: Isoelectricity / ion electron configs, size of atoms, size of associated ions, ionization energies, and electron affinities.

#### Isoelectronic Ions and Atoms
* **MSJ** Chapter 7.8 Ion Electron Configurations, p. 251-252
* **Isoelectronic** atoms and ions have the same number of electrons and in the same orbital configurations.
* Group 1-3 metals do this by becoming positive cations (aka lose electrons).
* Group 14-17 (aka 4A - 7A) nonmetals do this by become negative anions (aka gain electrons). They ultimately have the "desired" octet of valence electrons equivalent to the noble gas (Group 18) in  their associated period. For Group 14-17 ions, they stay in the same period. 
* For Group 1-3 metals, these atoms become cations by losing electrons to get "demoted" back to the noble gas in the previous period. 
See illustration on p. 251; all the species in the same row have the same color and are *isoelectronic* with each other.

#### Electron Affinity 
* **MSJ** Chapter 7.12, p. 260 - 261.
* Not to be confused with electronegativity, even though they seem similar in concept and share the same trends on the periodic table (aka highest in upper right near Fluorine, lowest near lower left near Francium).
* Electronegativity is a dimensionless measure whose range was arbitrarily set by Linus Pauling and only relevant within a molecule.
* In contrast, **electron affinity** is a directly measured *unit of energy* released when an electron is added to a neutral atom in the gaseous state to form a negative ion. aka, the amt of energy you need to **add* to a anion to get it to give up its extra electron(s) to become a neutral atom. 
* Thus, main group metals in Groups 1 and 2 have low electron affinities because it's super easy for them to give up electrons b/c they prefer to be positive cations.
* High electron affinity atoms "want" electrons more, e.g., non metals like Flurorine in Group 17 (7A) with low periods like period 2 or 3. These elements strongly prefer to be negative anions and you need to add a lot of energy to it to have them give up their extra electrons to become neutral atoms. 
* Some good answers on [this message board page](https://lavelle.chem.ucla.edu/forum/viewtopic.php?t=35085).

## Chapter 8: Covalent Bonding, Intro to Lewis Structures, Hydrocarbons, Molecular Orbital Theory

* p. 297 - contrast between *atomic* orbital theory and *molecular* orbital theory in Section 8.10 to explain **paramagnetism** in O<sub>2</sub> implying unpaired electrons, even though naive Lewis structure predicts **diamagnetism**
* p. 277 saturated hydrocarbons like butane VS. 2methylpropane branched chain
* p. 277 cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane 
* p. 278 C=O is a carbonyl group.
* p. 278-279 Aldehydes are hydrocarbons that have a -CHO functional group aka an "aldehyde functional group" which necessarily includes a carbonyl. 
* Whereas **alkanes** ( p.277) are necessarily saturated (aka have maximum # of hydrogens possible aka no double bonds between carbons), **alkenes** (p. 280) are hydrocarbons that have at least 1 C=C double bond. 
* **Alkynes** are unsaturated hydrocarbons as well, but unlike alkenes, alkynes have triple bonds between carbon atoms. 

### Names of first several saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons

| No. of carbons | Alkanes  | Alkenes                 | Alkynes                |
|----------------|----------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| 1              | methane  | –                     | –                    |
| 2              | ethane   | ethene *aka* **ethylene**    | ethyne *aka* **acetylene** |

| 11             | undecane | 1-undecene              | 1-undecyne             |


## Chapter 9: Molecular Structures, VSEPR, Orbital Hybridization, Noncovalent Interactions, and Intermolecular Forces
* **MSJ** p. 310, Figure 9.4 table listing names and shapes of common molecular structures around a central atom: linear, trigonal planar, trigonal bipyramidal, tetrahedral, octahedral. 
* p. 316, Figure 9.6 table illustrating more exotic shapes with 5 or 6 shared electron bonds and/or lone pairs surrounding a central atom: trigonal bipyramidal, seesaw, T-shaped, linear, octahedral, square pyramidal, square planar
### Hybridization of orbitals, sigma bonds, pi bonds, steric number
* **MSJ** Chapter 9
* Lone pair = pair of valence electrons that are not bonded/shared covalently with another atom. Eg., ammonia NH<sub>3</sub> has steric number of 4 = 3 sigma bonds to hydrogen + 1 lone pair.
* Valence Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. See [Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSEPR_theory) and MSJ Chapter 9.2 (p. 309-318)

### Section 9.5: Molecular Polarity
* p. 325 caused by both difference in electronegativity between different atoms in a molecule *and* the organization of charges in the molecular structure
* For example, compare CF<sub>4</sub> is nonpolar because of molecular symmetry while CHF<sub>3</sub> is *polar* because the hydrogen atom throws off tetrahedral symmetry - p. 327

### Section 9.6: Noncovalent Interactions
 * Noncovalent interactions refer to all forces of attraction apart from covalent bonds, ionic bonds, and metallic bonds. p. 329
 * Noncovalent bonds can refer to both intramolecular and intermolecular forces
 * Primary categories: London Forces, Dipole-Dipole Forces, and Hydrogen Bonds


## Chapter 12: Chemical Kinetics, Rate Law, Mechanisms, Catalysts, Enzymes
* Example of methane combustion in bunsen burner with and without fire. CH<sub>4</sub> + 2 O<sub>2</sub> --> CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O - p. 415
* Four factors that impact speed of reaction when all reactants and products are in the same phase (eg all are gases or all are in solution) *aka* in a **homogeneous reaction**:
	1. molecular structure and bonds
	1. concentration
	1. temperature
	1. presence and concentration of catalyst (if any)
* In addition, if we are talking about input/output that are in different phases aka a **heterogeneous reaction**:
	1. area of reaction surface
	1. nature of reaction surface

### Example of crystal violet Cv<sup>+</sup> reaction rate (p. 417)
* Colorful crystal violet dye (abbreviated Cv<sup>+</sup>) combining with hydroxide ion (OH<sup>-</sup>) to produce colorless product CvOH\ on p. 417-419. The full formula is crystal violet chloride combining with sodium hydroxide to form the CvOH and sodium chloride:
	* **CvCl** (ions in solution) + **NaOH** (ions in solution) --> **CvOH** (colorless product) + **NaCl** (ions in solution)
* The notation for "concentration of" uses brackets. e.g., [Cv<sup>+</sup>] is pronounced "concentration of crystal violet dye".
* Average reainction rate is delta [Cv<sup>+</sup>] / delta time. And since the concentration of Cv<sup>+</sup> decreases over time but reaction rate is usually measured as a positive rate, the final equation has a negative in it. Average reaction rate from time t<sub>1</sub> to t<sub>2</sub> =   **- &#916;[Cv<sup>+</sup>] / &#916;t**

### Example of NO<sub>2</sub> --> NO + O<sub>2</sub>, (p. 419)
* The crystal violet Cv<sup>+</sup> example from p. 417, one mole of each reactant (aqueous Cv<sup>+</sup> and aqueous OH<sup>-</sup>) produces one mole of the colorless product CvOH.  A nice one-to-one ratio so the reaction rate is *the same* regardless of whether we are measuring **[Cv<sup>+</sup> cation in solution]**, **[OH<sup>-</sup> anion in solution]**, or **[CvOH molecule]**
* In contrast, consider the reaction **2 NO<sub>2</sub> (gas) --> 2 NO (g) + O<sub>2</sub> (g)**. There is a 2:1 ratio between the reactant NO<sub>2</sub> and the product O<sub>2</sub>. This means the reaction rate seems different depending on if we measure [NO<sub>2</sub>] or [O<sub>2</sub>].
* To resolve this, we define reaction rate using stoichiometry with Equation 12.3 (p. 419): 
	* Let lowercase a,b,c,d be coefficients and upper case A,B,C,D be chemicals in the following reaction formula: aA +bB --> cC + dD
	* Then the uniform reaction rate is equivalent for the following:
		* Rate = - (1/**a**)(&#916;[**A**]/&#916;t) *reactant A*
		* Rate = - (1/**b**)(&#916;[**B**]/&#916;t) *reactant B*
		* Rate = + (1/**c**)(&#916;[**C**]/&#916;t) *product C*
		* Rate = + (1/**d**)(&#916;[**D**]/&#916;t) *product D*

## Different versions of 7.01 Intro Bio (course at MIT)

[Fundamentals of Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/syllabus/) was designed specifically for independent study and OpenCourseWare.
