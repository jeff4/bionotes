## Chapter 2: Inorganic Chem Fundamentals - p. 21-38

### Chapter 2.1: How does Atomic Structure Explain the Properties of Matter?
* Review of electron orbitals p. 24-25 
	* See also [this Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_shell)
	* Remember:
		* First Shell: *1s<sup>2</sup>* = total of **2 electrons** in this shell.
		* Second Shell: *2s<sup>2</sup> + 2p<sup>6</sup>* = total of **8 electrons** in this shell.
		* Third Shell: *3s<sup>2</sup> + 3p<sup>6</sup> + 3d<sup>10</sup>* = total of **18 electrons** in this shell.
		* Fourth Shell: *4s<sup>2</sup> + 4p<sup>6</sup> + 4d<sup>10</sup> + 4f<sup>14</sup>* = total of **32 electrons** in this shell.
		* Fifth Shell: *5s<sup>2</sup> + 5p<sup>6</sup> + 5d<sup>10</sup> + 5f<sup>14</sup> + 5g<sup>18</sup>* = total of **50 electrons** in this shell.
	* Filling order is based on [the Aufbau principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufbau_principle) aka the [Madelung energy ordering rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufbau_principle#Madelung_energy_ordering_rule):
		* 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p, 8s, etc.

### Concept of Electronegativity - p. 28
* When two atoms of different elements are covalently bonded in a molecule, there electrons are not equally shared. So one of the positively charged nuclei may exert a greater attractive force on the shared electron pair than the other nucleus. This attractive force is called **electronegativity**.2
	* p. 28: atoms with similar electronegativity = **nonpolar covalent bond**. Atoms with different electronegativity produce a **polar covalent bond**.
	* Extreme electronegativity = powerful positive proton nuclues which leads to ability to attract greater than "fair share" of shared electrons in a molecule
	* maps to having almost having enough electrons in valencce shell to complete s2p6 octet
	* in general, most electronegative columns in the periodic table are Groups 16 & 17 because they have 6 & 7 electrons, respectively in their outer valence shell.
	* conversely, the least electronegative groups in the periodic table are Groups 1 & 2 which respectively have 1 & 2 electrons in their outermost shell and these are the easiest electrons to lose.
	* at the limit, when superstrong-electronegative and superweakly-electronegative elements interact, they don't just form a hyper-polar covalent bond; instead actually turn into an Ionic Bond.

### Ionic Bonds - p. 28-29
* When 2 interacting atoms have a large enough difference in electronegativity, ions form as the more powerfully electronegative nucleus strips electrons away from the weakly electronegative (aka positive atom). 
* Example of sodium Na and chlorine Cl
	* Na has its 1st two shells filled (aka *1s<sup>2</sup>* + *2s<sup>2</sup> + 2p<sup>6</sup>*). Also, as a [Group I element](https://iupac.org/what-we-do/periodic-table-of-elements/), it also has an extra electron in the next subshell: 3s<sup>2</sup> aka the first electron to appear in Shell M. It is easy to lose this electron.
	* Meanwhile, Cl only has 7 electrons in its  *3s<sup>2</sup> + 3p<sup>6</sup>* subshells. But ideally it would "like" **8 electrons** to complete subshell *3p<sup>6</sup>*. 
	* So in solution, Cl's more electronegative (aka more positive) nucleus "steals" the sole electron in Na's outermost subshell 3s<sup>2</sup>.
	* This produces a **positive cation** Na<sup>+</sup> and a **negative anion**  Cl<sup>-</sup> .
* This also explains the octet rule for molecules formed by atoms where *s<sup>2</sup> and p<sup>6</sup>* subshells are concerned.

### Hydrogen bonds
* Salts and interactions with polar molecules - p. 29
* Good interactive page on [hemoglobin and primary, secondary, tertiary, and quartenary structure](https://www.labxchange.org/library/items/lb:LabXchange:99c39c9f:lx_simulation:1)

### Chapter 2.4: H<sub>2</sub>0 has special properties - p. 32-34
* Water has a tetrahedral shape with oxygen in the center, two of the tetrahedral vertices occupied by hydrogen atoms, and the two remaining vertices occupied by an unbonded electron pair. Because oxygen has a high electronegativity relative to hydrogen, there is a  partial *delta-positive* charge on each hydrogen. Conversely, there is a partial *delta-negative* charge on each unbonded electron pair on the other two vertices. 
* In a liquid state, water molecules are connected to each other by hydrogen bonds. These strings of water molecules give water cohesion as well as a very high boiling point (to break the hydrogen bonds).
* When water freezes and turns into a solid, the daisy chain of randomly appearing/disappearing hydrogen bonds form into more permanent hydrogen bonds. These new hydrogen bonds follow from the partial delta-charges; the result is a  "hollow" crystal structure for ice which is why is less dense than liquid water. 

### Misc

## Notes on various versions of Intro Bio course at MIT 7.01

[Fundamentals of Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/syllabus/) was designed specifically for independent study and OpenCourseWare. It draws upon material developed for the three versions of MIT's Introductory Biology classes known as 7.012, 7.013, and 7.014. All three classes cover the same core material, which includes the fundamental principles of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology. In addition, each version of the subject has its own distinctive material.

According to [this page](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/), these courses were recorded in the following years

* [Fall, 2004](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/index.htm) - **7.012** with Professors Eric Lander and Robert Weinberg, focuses on genomics, neurobiology, and cancer cell biology.  
* **7.013** with Professors Hazel Sive and Tyler Jacks, focuses on development and cancer cell biology has been recorded twice:
	* [Spring 2018](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-013-introductory-biology-spring-2018/)  *(The Savada 10th Ed textbook I have is for this version of 7.013)*
	* [Spring 2013](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-013-introductory-biology-spring-2013/) 
* [Spring, 2005](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-014-introductory-biology-spring-2005/) - **7.014**, with Professors Graham Walker and Penny Chisholm, focuses on ecology and environment.
