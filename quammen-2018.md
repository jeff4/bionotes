## Part I:
### Chapter 1-2
* Review of Darwin's early life

### Chapter 3
* p. 10 - Quammen cites Revelations, the last book of the New Testament as an early example of the phrase "tree of life".  The [King James version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5c2iRHlAHA) of Revelations 22:1-2 reads: 
	* *And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb*
	* *In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there** the tree of life**, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of nations.*
	* See this passage per [the New International Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022&version=NIV)
* In the 4th century BCE, Aristotle organizes animals as a ladder with no mention of trees. Aristotle's linear "ladder of nature" is later Latinized to [*scala naturae*](https://sites.google.com/site/aristotlethebiologist/aristotle-s-biology/great-chain-of-being). By the Middle Ages, this Neo-Platonic ladder is also called the [Great Chain of Being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_chain_of_being), the *Ladder of Ascent*, and *the Descent of the Intellect*. (p. 10-11)
* Charles Bonnet, an 18th-century Swiss naturalist, wrote a treatise on insects that vertically arranges an 'Idea of a Scale of Natural Beings', "ascending from fire, air, and water, through earth and various minerals, upward to mushrooms, lichens, plants, and then sea anemones, followed by tapeworms and snails and slugs, upward further to fish and then flying fish in particular, and then birds, above which came bats and flying squirrels, then four-legged mammals, monkeys, apes, and lastly man."
	* Notably, Bonnet ignored microbes, even though van Leeuwenhoek had discovered them about 70 years before. 



### Chapter 8
* "Darwin and Darwin's followers owned the tree image now. It would remain the best graphic representation of life's history, evolution through time, the origins of diversity and adaptation, until the late twentieth century...[until Woese and other scientists] would discover: oops no, it's wrong." (p. 34)
