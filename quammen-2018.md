## Part I:
### Chapter 1-2
* Review of Darwin's early life

### Chapter 3
* p. 10 - Quammen cites Revelations, the last book of the New Testament as an early example of the phrase "tree of life".  The [King James version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5c2iRHlAHA) of Revelations 22:1-2 reads: 
	* *And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb*
	* *In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there** the tree of life**, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of nations.*
	* See this passage per [the New International Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022&version=NIV)
* In the 4th century BCE, Aristotle organizes animals as a ladder with no mention of trees. Aristotle's linear "ladder of nature" is later Latinized to [*scala naturae*](https://sites.google.com/site/aristotlethebiologist/aristotle-s-biology/great-chain-of-being). By the Middle Ages, this Neo-Platonic ladder is also called the [Great Chain of Being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_chain_of_being), the *Ladder of Ascent*, and *the Descent of the Intellect*. (p. 10-11)
* Charles Bonnet, an 18th-century Swiss naturalist, wrote a treatise on insects that vertically arranges an 'Idea of a Scale of Natural Beings', "ascending from fire, air, and water, through earth and various minerals, upward to mushrooms, lichens, plants, and then sea anemones, followed by tapeworms and snails and slugs, upward further to fish and then flying fish in particular, and then birds, above which came bats and flying squirrels, then four-legged mammals, monkeys, apes, and lastly man."
	* Notably, Bonnet ignored microbes, even though van Leeuwenhoek had discovered them about 70 years before. (p. 11)
* By the late 1700s and the early 1800s, the old linear tree was less satisfactory because the Age of Discovery and many for collecting and organizing had led to an explosion of species to catalog. 
* "Scholars wanted to set that explosive abundance of new facts within hierarchical categories so that it could be easily accessed and used. **This wasn't evolutionary thinking; it was just data management.** (p. 12)
* 1801, Augustin Augier wrote in 1801 that "a figure like a genealogical tree appears to be the most proper to grasp the order and gradation" of the diversity of plants. (p. 13)
	* In Augier's book was a figure representing his new system for cataloging plants: "an *arbre botanique* (botanical tree)."
	* "Augier was no evolutionist before his time. His natural order wasn't meant to suggest that all plants had descended from common ancestors by some sort of material process of transformation."
	* "Augier's contribution...was discovering [the Creator's] proportions and progressions–design principles that had satisfied the Deity's neat sense of pattern–and using them after the fact to organize botanical knowledge into a tidy system."
* Carl Linnaeus published the first edition of his *System Naturae* in 1735. (p. 15)



### Chapter 8
* "Darwin and Darwin's followers owned the tree image now. It would remain the best graphic representation of life's history, evolution through time, the origins of diversity and adaptation, until the late twentieth century...[until Woese and other scientists] would discover: oops no, it's wrong." (p. 34)
