### Articles on setting up python environment
* First, install mamba as a lighter weight and faster alternative to conda
* Next, install jupyter notebook server which relies on mamba + python
* Also read this article on [Managing Python Environment in 2022](https://aseifert.com/p/python-environments/)
* Less necessary, but read [this section](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#what-other-popular-options-exist-aside-from-venv) of this longer, more comprehensive [article](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) on understanding venv in particular. But it also has comments on virtualenv, conda, etc.
