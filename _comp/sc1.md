* **6:23** - comparison with other languages. Page count of how long each language specication is for Scheme, vs. C, C++, Java, C#, JS.  
	* Most of those specs do not include libraries. Closest is C at 176 pages
	* Scheme comes in under 50 pages, which includes the standard libraries
* **8:30** Two models for programming: Turing Machines and Lambda Calculus.
	* They can accomplish all the sam things, but operate very differently. 
* **9:15** A lot of people think of Scheme as a functional programming language. That's technically *not* true because functional programming languages do not allow assignments but Scheme does.
* Updated reports
