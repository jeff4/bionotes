* **6:23** - comparison with other languages. Page count of how long each language specication is for Scheme, vs. C, C++, Java, C#, JS.  
	* Most of those specs do not include libraries. Closest is C at 176 pages
	* Scheme comes in under 50 pages, which includes the standard libraries
* **8:30** Two models for programming: Turing Machines and Lambda Calculus.
	* They can accomplish all the sam things, but operate very differently. 
* **9:15** A lot of people think of Scheme as a functional programming language. That's technically *not* true because functional programming languages do not allow assignments but Scheme does.
	* Most Scheme programmers try to mostly avoid using assignments but it is not completely forbidden.
* Scheme is standardized through **R*n*RS** where *n* refers to an integer. Full name is Revised<sup>n</sup> Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme.
	* For more, see the [Standardization section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Scheme_programming_language#Standardization) of the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Scheme_programming_language) on the history of SCheme.
	* The latest large standard is [R6RS](https://www.r6rs.org), ratified in 2007.
	* The latest small revision is called [R7RS](https://r7rs.org) from 2022. The [website](https://www.r6rs.org) contains PDF and [html versions](https://standards.scheme.org/corrected-r7rs/r7rs.html) for the R7RS spec.
