# Comp Notes
* 2/21/2021 - upgraded laptop to Big Sur. Downloaded Atom editor.
* 2/22/2021 - downloaded Command Line Tools for Mac OS v. 12.4 and was able to get "Hello World" working in Atom and cmdline using clang. Appropriate because it has been exactly 43 years and 1 day since K&R pubished this, per [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/23/hello-world) and [CSAIL at MIT](https://twitter.com/MIT_CSAIL/status/1363875135191678984).
