* Note: Most common acronym for **DITA** = Darwin Information Typing Architecture. ETL related  may be Data Integration and Transformation Architecture. Yet another one might be Document Information Type Architecture. regardless, i asked this of ChatGPT: 'Other than Darwin Information Typing Architecture, what other meanings does the acronym DITA refer to in the world of computers and/or information technology'

### Chatlog with 3b-chat.py 9/11/2023

* You: Does BusinessWeek publish a list called the Global 1000?
* ChatBot: BusinessWeek does publish various lists related to businesses and management. However, it seems that they do not currently publish a list specifically named "the Global 1000". The magazine does regularly evaluate and rank companies on a global scale, but you'll want to check with their specific publications for the most accurate information. Bloomberg purchased BusinessWeek in late 2009 and it's now known as Bloomberg Businessweek.
* You: What are commonly used lists of the largest companies in the world, whether by annual revenue or market capitalization? I'm interested in more than the lists of American corporations tracked by the S&P 500, so please give me international or global examples if you can.
* ChatBot: Certainly, the most frequently referred to lists of the largest companies worldwide include:

	1. Fortune Global 500: An annual ranking by Fortune magazine. This list is based on revenue and includes companies across the globe.
	2. Forbes Global 2000: Compiled by Forbes magazine, this ranking uses a combination of sales, profit, assets and market value to rank companies from all around the world.
	3. FT Global 500: This list by Financial Times includes the world's largest companies by market capitalization.
	4. Bloomberg Global 1000: Similar to the above, Bloomberg provides a global ranking based on market capitalization.
	5. Fortune/Forbes/FT lists by region or country: There are also lists that break down the largest companies specifically by region like the Asia-Pacific region, or by country – for example China's 500, India's hayırlısı olsunverging companies, etc.

* Remember to check data date or updating schedule of the lists, for things can change fairly fast in the business world.
