## 8/26/2024
* get started with GVU book.
* Up to location 117/3051
* Also began watching the 3-hour [Vue.js Crash Course 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeNfHj6MhgA) by Traversy Media. Up to 17:17 rn.
* Began going through [Vue Intro docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)

## Notes on Vue.JS docs
### Single-File Components
* A `*.vue` file is a SFC (Single-File Component) file that is similar to HTML.
* It must consist of three parts:
	1. Logic -- Javascript in the `/* script */` section
	1. Content -- HTML in the `/* template */` section
	1. Styling -- CSS in the `/* style */` section
* of course, a regular HTML document has *script* and *style* sections to hold onto parts 1 and 3 respectively. So as we can see, SFC / *.vue files are very similar to `*.html` files.
* Per my reading of this [Composition API FAQ](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq), i believe i'll just go with the classic **Options API** for now b/c i'm mostly doing small and simple projects for now. However, at some point, I may learn the **Composition API** as well. Or go directly to React. That article also has a nice comparison of the Vue Composition API vs. React Hooks.
* Sped through the [vue.js tutorial](https://vuejs.org/tutorial/#step-1)
* Built my own vue app with the [quick start](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html)
