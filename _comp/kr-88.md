# Kernighan and Ritchie
* [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools), 2nd Edition (1988)
* Authors: Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie

### General notes
* 3/06/2021: [clang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang#Background) expects an integer return in the main method, specifically **int** main(). The older ANSI C 1988 standard aka [C88](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C#Standardizing_C) does not seem to require this. Therefore, the C code listed in K&R always start with *main()* rather than *int main()*.
