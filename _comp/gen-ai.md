## 2023 Log
* 2/09 - Got stable diffusion working on the Mac Studio and documented all the steps.
* 2/12 - Review Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville on history of autoencoders
* 2/13 - more GBC on autoencoders, refers to GOFAI/symbolic approach as "knowledge base" approach. But I think KB was really an 80s subset of symbolic overall approach.
* 2/21 - read [Stephen Wolfram](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/) and [Murray Shanhan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03551) Feb 2023 articles on LLM
* 2/23 - more articles on history of BERT, transformers, MUM, etc.
	* This 18 minute [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/wi0M2J4uE5I) by Mean Gene Hacks compares 3 LLMs that all have about 175 B parameters: OpenAI's GPT-3, BigScience's BLOOM, and Facebook's OPT-175 
* 2/24 - Today, [FB released LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) (Large Langauge Model Meta AI) in 4 sizes 7 billion parameters, 13 billion parameters, 33B parameters, and 65B parameters. Yann LeCun claims that LLaMa-13B outperforms GPT-3 (even though the latter has 175B). And LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models like Chinchilla70B and PaLM-540B.
* 2/26 - Mt. AI / volcanic island / infiinite skycraper
* 3/03 Adam Gopnik NYer article on DALL-E
