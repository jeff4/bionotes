* Three ways of attaching styles to a document
	1. Inline styles (most primitive, less modular/scalable, not recommended). e.g. `<h1 style="color : dark-grey">Chapter 1 </h1>`.
	1. Embedded style sheet where one places all styles within a `<style> ... </style>` block inside the HTML `<head>` section.
	1. External style sheet. Most scalable. Either imported via the 
		*  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="file.css">` in the `<head>` section
		* **#import** rule
* Got `st1.css` and `st2.css` working in proj3 directory. Used some sample templates from [SheCodes.io](https://palettes.shecodes.io).
* p. 242. syntax is **selector {**`declaration`**}**, where `declaration` = list of *property:value* pairs.

### Selectors p. 243
#### More detail in later chapters, but for now...
1. *Element-type* selectors include `<h1>` and `<p>` and `body`.
1. *ID* selectors select element based on **id** atributes. Indicated by `#` symbol.
