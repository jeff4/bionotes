* What is syntax for calling an external `styles.css` file within an HTML page?
* I've seen how to do it embedded in-line within HTML and within the `<styles>` tags.
* Got `st1.css` and `st2.css` working in proj3 directory. Used some sample templates from [SheCodes.io](https://palettes.shecodes.io).
* p. 242. syntax is **selector {**`declaration`**}**, where `declaration` = list of *property:value* pairs.
