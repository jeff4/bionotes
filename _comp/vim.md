* 3/04 - From this Hacker News [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33812893)
	* Best user manual and [guide with examples](https://vimhelp.org/usr_01.txt.html#usr_01.txt) is built into the editor.

* 3/05 Famous Stackover Flow [answer from 8/09/2009](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118)--epic explanation about how to grok vi.
	* From same thread is this [answer from 2010](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2559262) which has a ton of shortcuts, a starter .vimrc file etc.
* 3/10 Figured out proper autocommands to change colorscheme based on Insert or Command mode.
* 3/11 Decide which new colorschemes to add. Partially inspired by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R7LOxOoAw0)

	* Also installed dracula, codedark, and personal favorite: Kolor.
* 3/21 Lots of progress documented in OneNote. For autocomplete based on other words in the document, go into Insert mode and try Ctrl-n and Ctrl-p. For more, see [this help doc](https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/insert.html#i_CTRL-N) or [this help doc](https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/insert.html#ins-completion)
* 3/23 Delighted by typing ci{ or di{ where i refers to "inside" and you can (c)hange or (d)elete everything inside those curly braces.
	* Works for ci* where * = parentheses, quotes, brackets, curly braces, any open/closed tokens.
* 3/25 Need to rewatch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQfFvExpZDU) on g commands. Off the top of my head:
	* gj and gk in the context of a long line of text which appears visually as a single paragraph allows one to move up and down *within* that paragraph without going to different lines
		* Also works by adding movement so g5j will move 5 lines down within the visual block of text
	* gu [text object] makes everything lowercase. gU [text object] makes everything uppercase.
		* e.g., gu$ makes everything lowercase to the end of the line.
		* e.g., gU5w makes the next 5 words uppercase
* 5/04 [List of vim-friendly apps and utilities](https://github.com/erikw/vim-keybindings-everywhere-the-ultimate-list) and associated [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35816361)
* 7/11 Vim's implementation of grep. Some links discussing various flavors of regex related to perl, vim, Basic Regular Expression (BRE) synatx, Extended Regular Expression (ERE) synatx, etc.

* 8/05 - Creator and maintainer of vim [Bram Moolenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar) passed away. :( [HN thread with personal anecdotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar)
* 8/27 - Created distinct [page for my sed notes](/sed/)

## 9/16/2023

* Got back into [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) because I want to have proper \*.astro syntax highlighting. Referencing the [vim-astro plugin](https://github.com/wuelnerdotexe/vim-astro). Adapted instructions from this [Linux vim-plug guide](https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/vim-plug-install-plugins). Main steps: (1) add a new line to `.vimrc`; (2) start new terminal window; and (3) Open a vim file and type `:PlugInstall`.
* I also edited my `.gitignore` file within `/proj-4/a2-astro` so that temporary vim files like `*.swp` and `*.swo` are not tracked/pushed by git, per [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4824188/git-ignore-vim-temporary-files#comment28311078_4824199)
	* Should read more about how [.gitignore works](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
* Note. I currently am able to indent pretty effectively with the `ctrl-v`, select how many rows with `j`, `shift-I`, type text or tabs to apply to all lines sequence. However, deletion (aka outdenting) doesn't seem to work to well. Reread section 5 [Blockwise operators](https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/visual.html#blockwise-operators) to see if I can fix this.
	* Another potential [resource](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Shifting_blocks_visually)

## 9/24/2023
* to switch immediately to tab number 'n', type `ngt`. e.g, to move to tab 5, type `5gt`.
* when invoking vim on the command line, typing `vim -p filename1.txt filename2.txt` will automatically open desired files all at once, each in its own tab all in the same instance of vim.


## 9/27/2023
* Very handy way of deleting to a `search string` e.g., 'Nashville'. Instead of typing `dtN`, type `d/Nashville` followed by <CR> or `Enter` key. See [this answer](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/14459/delete-to-next-search-result)
* Note that to search backwards, `Shift-/` aka `?` works just like usual reverse search. e.g., instead of typing `dTN`, type `d?Nashville` followed by <CR> or `Enter` key. 

## 10/11/2023
* vim has a built in sort utility works very well. If you want to sort all lines `:%sort u`. For more see [this article](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Sort_lines#:~:text=Yes%2C%20it%27s%20that%20simple.,%27%3E%20on%20the%20command%20line.)

## 2/05/2024
* Notes on `qq` macro recordings can be found in a7 > History of Technology section > Pasquinelli Chapter 2 *aka* `54-pas-chap2`.
* Notes on new `qq` macro recordings can be found in a7 > Eng > Part II Diallectics *aka* `72-p2`.

## 2/06/2024
* This is how you paste into the `:` command line, officially called the *Ex command line*. Add something to the default register using `y` for yank, e.g., `yl` for 1 letter, `yw` for 1 word.
	* e.g., `yb` for one word backward
	* Then, go to ex cmd line by typing <esc> and typing `:`
	* `<Ctrl> + r` and then type *"* to access the default register
	* Can type `"a` to access the **a** register
* For more detailed instructions in how to enter in escape/control characters, see [this comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3997078/how-to-paste-yanked-text-into-the-vim-command-line)

## 2/15/2024
* Began thinking of transitioning from vim to Neovim. See comparisons in this [Baeldung Linux article](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/vim-vs-neovim)


## 6/25/2024
* When using the `:%s` regex, remember that `\n` refers to the newlines in the search field, and `\r` refers to newlines in the replace field.
	* So for example, if you want to replace *text* \<newline\> with *text* **;** \<newline\>, you would type `%s|\n|;\r|gc`.
* Use [this article](https://www.brianstorti.com/vim-registers/) to understand how to add and retrieve characters from registers. For cut and paste. 
	* For example, to add everyting from the cursor to the end of the line `$` to the register `a`, type `"ay$`. B/c y = (y)ank and $ indicates the end of the current line.
	* Then, to paste what's in the register `a`, simply type `"ap`.

## 7/07/2024
* Repeated instructions on how to store and paste with register
#### Example 1
* to yank next 3 words and store in register **a**, type `"ay3w`.
* to paste item in register **a**, type `"ap`.
#### Example 2
* to yank from current cursor to end of line and store in register **b**, type `"by$`.
* to paste item in register **b**, type `"bp`.

## 7/09/2024
* Equivalent to **Save As...** in macOS / Windows / Office. Type `:w {pathname}/{NEW filename}` will write current file contents into the NEW file. Note that this does *not* save current contents into the current file so you must type `:w` separately to make sure that happens. See more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4980194).

## 8/03/2024
* Let's install LSP server and relevant plugins for syntax highlighting snd CoC code completion for TypeScript and React
* Note: `:bd` in vim clears the current buffer (aka closes the window like if you are in PlugInstall) without quitting vim. Before this, I was using `:q` to quit vim entirely to clear away PlugInstall. For more, see [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23592407)

### Steps
1. Watched this YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/n6JEqPuWOxg?si=hI6hUuiYtQym2EFJ&t=51) by [Nir Lichtman](https://www.youtube.com/@nirlichtman) at 51 seconds. You can see his [.vimrc file](https://github.com/nir9/welcome/blob/86d44256e856fede939ba33088f2631b3335cb5e/.vimrc) at GitHub
1. Edit my own `.vimrc` file
1. Make sure these plug-ins are included within the `call plug#begin( expand() )` and `call plug#end()` lines. 

```vim
Plug 'prabirshrestha/vim-lsp'
Plug 'mattn/vim-lsp-settings'
```
1. Hm. Looks like I may need to upgrade my version of vim which is currently at 9.0. But CoC requires 9.0.0438 per [these instructions](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Install-coc.nvim#requirements). 
1. So I will use brew to update my vim. Currently using default that came with macOS, stored in `/usr/bin/vim`. 
1. Went through `brew update; doctor; upgrade` cycle for all machines.
1. Now installing vim using `brew install vim`. For more context, see the [Homebrew vim page](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/vim)
1. Success. Now, running updated vim version 9.1 (02 Jan 2024)
	* On x86, running from the  `/usr/local/bin/vim` directory . 
	* On arm64 Apple Silicon, running from the  `/opt/homebrew/bin/vim` directory .

### More steps
* Open up vim, and run plug install with `:PlugInstall` and choose Yes to install the new vim plugins.
* Next time you open up any particular filetype with a `*.c`, `*.js`, `*.ts`, etc. type **:LspInstallServer** and press `Y` for yes. This will ensure that the desired Language Server is installed.
* To disable everything, just go to the .vimrc file and comment out the 2 lines for the lsp plugins: prabir.../vim-lisp` and `mattn/vim-lsp-settings`.
* No need to rerun :PlugInstall, uninstall, etc, it will all be turned off.
* Also, looks like there is a TypeScript LSP that automatically pops up when I open `*.js` files. But *not* any default JS Lsp's.
* Ok got all machines working. Can easily toggle on/off lsp functionality by commenting on/off 2 plugins in `.vimrc`.

## 8/31/2024
* Let's install neovim so i can take advantage of code completion etc for TypeScript, Vue, and React projects.
* Reran usual brew hygeine commands, see OneNote

## Some tutorials for today's setup
1. Feb 2024 - [Ultimate Vim Vue Setup](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/ultimate-vim-vue-setup/). Vim, not neovim
1. Feb 2024- YouTube by Dreams of Code: [The perfect Neovim setup for Next.js (it's back)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8um8OYwvz3c)


## Notes on Neovim setup from Dreams of Code tutorial
### Part 1: Initial setup
1. Installing latest stable build of neovim, release 0.10. In video, they are using 0.9.4.
1. Installed with `brew install neovim`
1. Updated .vimrc file for shortcut for nvim commands
1. In addition to installing neovim, need to install **git** and **nerdfonts**. Both are installed already.
1. Next, go with basic config. [DoC](https://youtu.be/8um8OYwvz3c?si=_khivyr_ukthnrER&t=86) recomends NVChad.
	* config file usually lives at `~/.config/nvim`
	* command to clone NVCad: `git clone -b v2.0 https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1`
	* creates **~/.config/nvim** directory.
1. To quickly switch the color theme, in *Cmd* mode, just type `<space>th`
	* CoD recommends 'catpuccino' theme
	* Because many themes break my macOS Terminal setup, i chose 'pastelbeans' which seems to work OK in both Alacritty and Terminal.

### Part 2: Configuring for JS and TS
1. Starting at 2:27, [CoD](https://youtu.be/8um8OYwvz3c?si=453isFitqTzkH81g&t=147) talks about what's needed.
1. LSP install. Naviate to `~/.config/nvim/lua/custom/`
	* Create a new **plugins.lua** file in that location like this: `~/.config/nvim/lua/custom/plugins.lua`
	* Edit the `.../nvim/lua/custom/chadrc.lua` file. Add these lines below the `M.ui = { theme = 'pastelbeans' }`: 
	```lua
	M.plugins = "custom.plugins"
	return M
	```
1. Verify that this is entered into `.../nvim/lua/custom/plugins.lua`:
```lua
local plugins = {
	{
		"neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
		config = function()
			require "plugins.configs.lspconfig"
		end,
	}
}
return plugins
```
1. Create a file named **lspconfig.lua** and store in `.../nvim/lua/custom/configs/lspconfig.lua` and add these contents:

```lua
local base = require("plugins.configs.lspconfig")
local on_attach = base.on_attach
local capabilities = base.capabilities

local lspconfig = require("lspconfig")

lspconfig.tsserver.setup({
	on_attach = on_attach,
	capabilities = capabilities,
})
```
1. Now to install the TypeScript lsp server. There are 2 ways of doing this:
    1. Using brew or other package managers on my local machine to download. Or perhaps use the PlugInstall for vim.
    1. Use the nvim specific installer **mason.nvim**. Advantage of this method is that this follows our config to another machine. Let's use *mason.nvim*.
1. So let's edit `.../nvim/lula/custom/plugins.lua` and add new lines ensuring that the typescript server is installed. Here is the complete version of the **plugins.lua** file up to this point:  

```lua
local plugins = {
  {
    "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
    config = function()
      require "plugins.configs.lspconfig"
    end,
  },
  {
    "williambowman/mason.nvim",
    opts = {
      ensure_installed = {
        "typescript-language-server",
      }
    }
  }
}
return plugins
```
