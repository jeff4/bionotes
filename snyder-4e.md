## Introduction
### Three Domains of Life  (p. 3-5) 
* Why three domains? 
	* "Sequence data show that *Homo sapiens* differ from chimpanzees by only about 2% of DNA sequence while 25-50% of the genes in a typical bacterium are unique to the species." (p. 3)
	* Also, while mammals diverged from each other in the ~100mya, bacterial lineages diverged on the order of billions of years ago.
	* p.6 - [Patrick Forterre suggested in 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1450140/) that all three domains lived in RNA world and all three independently developed DNA as the archival medium from three distinct infections from three different DNA viruses.
* **Domain 1: Bacteria (p. 3)**
	* Challenging to use [traditional phenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenetics) to classify bacteria based on their shapes, sizes, and appearances even though there is great diversity here. Better to use 16s of [rRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA#Sequence_Conservation_and_Stability).
	* Cyanobacteria were originally confused for plants (deprecated name: blue-green algae) because they have chlorophyll and are often filamentous. In fact [filamentous cyanobacteria are multicellular](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-07/ez-hmc071219.php).
	* Gram-staining
		* Gram-positive bacteria have a thick outer structure consisting of an inner membrane surrounded by a thicker wall. This is where the Gram dye accumulates
		* Gram-negative bacteria have a thinner covering consisting of two soft membranes: inner and outer thin membranes.  
	* **Gram-positive** species turn deep blue 
		* High G+C percentage in DNA branch: actinomycetes, Mycobacterium
		* Low G+C percentage in DNA branch include Actinobacteria and Firmicutes (Bacillus, clostridia, lactic acid bacteria, mycoplasms)
	* **Gram-negative** species turn pink
		* Streptomyces spp
		* Proteobacteria, e.g., E. coli, Psudomonas, Rhizobium
		* 
		* 
* **Domain 2: Archaea (p. 3-5)**
	* Most [extremophiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile) are archaea, but archaea are also live in many non-extreme environmments (p.5)
	* Two primary phyla:
		* [Euryarchaeota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euryarchaeota) which include methanogens, halophiles, and hyperthermophiles
		* [Crenarchaeota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crenarchaeota) which include sulfur-dependent thermophiles and perhaps the most well-studied archeaon [*Sulfolobus solfataricus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfolobus_solfataricus) 
* **Domain 3: Eukaryotes (p. 5)**
	* Includes all nucleus- and organelle-bearing species such as plants, animals, fungi, as well as all single-celled eukaryotes (e.g., yeast and all other [protists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist)).
	* From a cladistic perspective, Protista is paraphyletic.
	* "In spite of widely diverse appearances, lifestyles, and relative complexity, all eukaryotes are remarkably similar at the biochemical level, particularly in their pathways for macromolecular synthesis."
	* [Endosymbiotic Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis) posits that mitochondria are descended from [*Alphaproteobacteria*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaproteobacteria) while chloroplasts are derived from ancestral [*Cyanobacteria*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria).

### Bacteriology Techniques and Advantages (p. 6-8)
* Bacteria are haploid
* Short generation times (20 minutes for *E. coli*)
* Asexual reproduction
* Colony growth on agar plates
* Colony purification (p. 7) and selection (p. 8)
* Serial dilutions
* Storing stocks of bacterial strains
* Genetic Exchange
