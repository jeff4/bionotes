* Authors: Larry Snyder, Joseph E. Peters, Tina M. Hekin, Wendy Champness
* Fourth Edition, 2013

## Introduction
### Three Domains of Life  (p. 3-5) 
* Why three domains? 
	* "Sequence data show that *Homo sapiens* differ from chimpanzees by only about 2% of DNA sequence while 25-50% of the genes in a typical bacterium are unique to the species." (p. 3)
	* Also, while mammals diverged from each other in the ~100mya, bacterial lineages diverged on the order of billions of years ago.
	* p.6 - [Patrick Forterre suggested in 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1450140/) that all three domains lived in RNA world and all three independently developed DNA as the archival medium from three distinct infections from three different DNA viruses.
* **Note, [spp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_taxonomy) refers to "several different unknown species under a known genus".**
* **Domain 1: Bacteria (p. 3)**
	* Challenging to use [traditional phenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenetics) to classify bacteria based on their shapes, sizes, and appearances even though there is great diversity here. Better to use 16s of [rRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA#Sequence_Conservation_and_Stability).
	* Cyanobacteria were originally confused for plants (deprecated name: blue-green algae) because they have chlorophyll and are often filamentous. In fact [filamentous cyanobacteria are multicellular](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-07/ez-hmc071219.php).
	* [*Streptomyces*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomyces) are gram-positive and are the largest genus of [Actinobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinobacteria). Appearance-wise, they form hyphae and stalks of spores which make them look like fungi.  
	* [*Caulobacter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caulobacter_crescentus) spp. are gram-negative and have both free-swimming and sessile forms that attach to surfaces through a holdfast structure.
	* *Myxococcus* are a type of gram-negative [myxobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxobacteria) that are similar to slime molds in that they can change from free-living single-celled organisms into aggregations of fruiting bodies.
	* [Gram-staining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_stain)
		* The [primary stain is crystal violet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_stain#Staining_mechanism) which accumulates in petidoglycan. [Petidoglycan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptidoglycan) is a polymer of sugar and amino acids and forms aa thick mesh-like material outside the plasma membrane of bacteria. 
			* Petidoglyocan contributes 50-90% to the cell envelope for **Gram-positive bacteria** but only ~10% of the cell envelope for **Gram-negative bacteria**.
			* After washing out excess crystal violet, only the Gram+ bacteria retain the stain, turning purple/violet.
			* The Gram-negative bacteria are counterstained with [safranin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safranin) and turn pink.
	* **Gram-positive** species turn purple after stain
		* High G+C percentage in DNA branch: actinomycetes, Mycobacterium
			* *Streptomyces* the most important genus of Actinobacteria. *Streptomyces spp* are an attractive alternative to *E. coli* when producing [industrial quantities of biotech materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomyces#Biotechnology). *Streptomyces* produce over two-thirds of clinically useful antibiotics of natural origin. 
		* Low G+C percentage in DNA branch include Actinobacteria and Firmicutes (Bacillus, clostridia, lactic acid bacteria, mycoplasms)
	* **Gram-negative** species turn pink after sstain
		* Proteobacteria, e.g., E. coli, Psudomonas, Rhizobium
		* [*Caulobacter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caulobacter_crescentus) spp. which are free-living and sessile
		* *Myxococcus* spp. such as [*Myxococcus xanthus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxococcus_xanthus) 
* **Domain 2: Archaea (p. 3-5)**
	* Most [extremophiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile) are archaea, but archaea are also live in many non-extreme environmments (p.5)
	* Two primary phyla:
		* [Euryarchaeota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euryarchaeota) which include methanogens, halophiles, and hyperthermophiles
		* [Crenarchaeota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crenarchaeota) which include sulfur-dependent thermophiles and perhaps the most well-studied archeaon [*Sulfolobus solfataricus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfolobus_solfataricus) 
* **Domain 3: Eukaryotes (p. 5)**
	* Includes all nucleus- and organelle-bearing species such as plants, animals, fungi, as well as all single-celled eukaryotes (e.g., yeast and all other [protists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist)).
	* From a cladistic perspective, Protista is paraphyletic.
	* "In spite of widely diverse appearances, lifestyles, and relative complexity, all eukaryotes are remarkably similar at the biochemical level, particularly in their pathways for macromolecular synthesis."
	* [Endosymbiotic Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis) posits that mitochondria are descended from [*Alphaproteobacteria*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaproteobacteria) while chloroplasts are derived from ancestral [*Cyanobacteria*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria).

### Bacteriology Techniques and Advantages (p. 6-8)
* Bacteria are haploid
* Short generation times (20 minutes for *E. coli*)
* Asexual reproduction
* Colony growth on agar plates
* Colony purification (p. 7) and selection (p. 8)
* Serial dilutions
* Storing stocks of bacterial strains
* Genetic Exchange

### Phage Genetics

### A Brief History of Bacterial Molecular Genetics (p. 9)
* Three types of lateral genetic transfer (LGT) aka [horizontal genetic transfer (HGT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer): 
	1. [Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer#Bacterial_transformation) – asynchronous absorption of DNA without viral vector
	1. [Conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer#Bacterial_conjugation) – sex between 2 connected bacteria via pilli
	1. [Transduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)) – asynchronous transmission of DNA via viral vector
