* Authors: Larry Snyder, Joseph E. Peters, Tina M. Hekin, Wendy Champness
* Fourth Edition, 2013

## Chapter 1
### Three Domains of Life  (p. 3-5) 
* Why three domains? 
	* "Sequence data show that *Homo sapiens* differ from chimpanzees by only about 2% of DNA sequence while 25-50% of the genes in a typical bacterium are unique to the species." (p. 3)
	* Also, while mammals diverged from each other in the ~100mya, bacterial lineages diverged on the order of billions of yeas ago.
* **Domain 1: Bacteria**
	* Challenging to use [traditional phenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenetics) to classify bacteria based on their shapes, sizes, and appearances even though there is great diversity here. Better to use 16s of [rRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA#Sequence_Conservation_and_Stability).
* **Domain 2: Archaea**
	* Most [extremophiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile) are archaea, but archaea are also live in many non-extreme environmments (p.5)
* **Domain 3: Eukaryotes**
