#### Natural Hierarchies Are Formed By Trees p. 22

#### The Linnean Hierarchy Is Quasi-Natural p. 24

#### Trees and Hierarchies Have Very Distinct Properties p. 25

#### Cladistics Is a Systematics Based On Trees p. 27

#### Phyla Have Split Personalities p. 31

#### Molecular Branchings Can Define Clades While Morphological Features Define Linnean Taxa p. 32

### Chapter 3: Development and Bodyplans p. 76

### Chapter 4: Morphological and Molecular Phylogenies p. 115
#### Assumed Evolutionary Histories Affect Morphologically Based Phylogenetic Hypotheses
