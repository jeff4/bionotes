## Chapter 1: The Nature of Phyla p. 7
### Genealogical Histories Can Be Traced in Trees Which Are Positional Structures p. 13

### Natural Biological Hierarachies Are Nested Structures of Functional Entities That Emerge When Complex Systems Are Organized p. 16 
* Several natural hierarchies associated with the origin and diversication of phyla:
	* Somatic hierarchy which describes the organization of bodies into systems, organs, tissues, cells, etc. (Eldredge 1985)
	* Ecological hierarchy (Valentine 1973b)
	* "Regulome" genomic hierarchies of genes, promoters, repressors, proteins, and other molecules related to development
	* Additionally there is the Linnean taxonomic hierarchy (see below).

#### There Are Four Major Types of Hierarchical Structures p. 16
* Type one: **Aggregative hierarchy** (Mayr 1982), exemplified by the classic Linnean taxonomic system. "The basic entities are discrete species, composed o individuals related by common descent, and identified by various biological attributes involving gene flow, and by morphological similarities."
	* "The ranks (aka categories) are fomed on the basis of increasingly generalized morphological resemblances, given monophyly of the entities (taxa)."
	* See Figure 1.5 on p. 17. 1.5A shows Linnaeus' original hierarchy for animals which had 5 levels (aka ranks): **4,400 species** organized into **312 genera** organized into **64 orders** organized into** 6 classes** all belonging to **1 Kingdom** Animalia. 
	* However, one can organize all 4400 species into a "flatter hierarchy" with fewer ranks such as in Figure 1.5B. The 312 genera are all direct subcategories of Kingdom for a total of 3 ranks: Kingdom > Genus > Species.
	* Conversely, one can have more of a "Peaked" Hierarcy as in Figure 1.5C, where the 4400 species are organized into 14 different ranks.
* Type two: **Cumulative aggregative hierarchy** (Valentine and May 1996) p. 18
	* This is where a "commander" joins each higher level; compare with type one plain aggregative hierarchy of Linnean system where "nothing new joins the hierarchy at any given rank. Organisms are aggregated into species, these same species are aggregated into genera, and so forth..." *without* additional 'leaders' joining as we move up the ranks.
	* Best example is the organization of armies.
* Type three: **Constitutive hierarchy** (Mayr 1982). "Each of the units in "The units in each level form physical parts of the units on the next higher level."
	* Example: the somatic hierarchy that underlies the construction of the organism."
	* Atoms &#8594; molecules &#8594; organelles &#8594; cells &#8594; tissues &#8594; organs &#8594; organ systems &#8594; individual organisms.
	* Note that there is an alternative constitutive hierarchy between colonial organisms versus true multicellular metazoans. See Figure 1.7 on p. 19
* Type four: **Cumulative constitutive hierarchy** (Valentine and May 1996) p. 20
	* Like type two, "commanders" may join the hierarchy as we move up each rank, and this is actually a more accurate rendering of the nested organization of metazoans described in type three above.
	* Specifically, "the extracellular matrix of metazoans which forms the 'glue' that holdds most of them together, is not present in cells."
	* "Extracellular matrix is a constitutent of tissues, however, and therefore it is present in all higher levels of the hierarchy such as organs, etc."
	* Similarly, various intracellular fluids which are not part of cells but *are* a part of tissues, organs, etc.
* The taxonomic (types 1 and 2) and somatic (types 3 and 4) hierarchies are logically joined at the level of the individual organism. 

#### Hierarchies Help Sort Out Relations Among Biological Features
* See reference to Peter Medawar's 1974 paper [*A Geometric Model of Reduction and Emergence*](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=NMAf65cDmAQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA57&ots=_AiER-J6Sw&sig=WkFwEV1u_-7AxgTnbnJOyQvfAV0#v=onepage&q&f=false). As one moves upwards from elementary particles, there is less infinite possiblity of what can be built, but the "complexity and richness of form and function encountered on the cellular level far outshines the drab sameness of collections of elementary particles." p. 21
