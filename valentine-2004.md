## Chapter 1: The Nature of Phyla p. 7
### Genealogical Histories Can Be Traced in Trees Which Are Positional Structures p. 13

### Natural Biological Hierarachies Are Nested Structures of Functional Entities That Emerge When Complex Systems Are Organized p. 16 
* Several natural hierarchies associated with the origin and diversication of phyla:
	* Somatic hierarchy which describes the organization of bodies into systems, organs, tissues, cells, etc. (Eldredge 1985)
	* Ecological hierarchy (Valentine 1973b)
	* "Regulome" genomic hierarchies of genes, promoters, repressors, proteins, and other molecules related to development
	* Additionally there is the Linnean taxonomic hierarchy (see below).

#### There Are Four Major Types of Hierarchical Structures p. 16
* Type one: **Aggregative hierarchy** (Mayr 1982), exemplified by the classic Linnean taxonomic system. "The basic entities are discrete species, composed o individuals related by common descent, and identified by various biological attributes involving gene flow, and by morphological similarities."
	* "The ranks (aka categories) are fomed on the basis of increasingly generalized morphological resemblances, given monophyly of the entities (taxa)."
	* See Figure 1.5 on p. 17. 1.5A shows Linnaeus' original hierarchy for animals which had 5 levels (aka ranks): **4,400 species** organized into **312 genera** organized into **64 orders** organized into** 6 classes** all belonging to **1 Kingdom** Animalia. 
	* However, one can organize all 4400 species into a "flatter hierarchy" with fewer ranks such as in Figure 1.5B. The 312 genera are all direct subcategories of Kingdom for a total of 3 ranks: Kingdom > Genus > Species.
	* Conversely, one can have more of a "Peaked" Hierarcy as in Figure 1.5C, where the 4400 species are organized into 14 different ranks.
* Type two: **Cumulative aggregative hierarchy** (Valentine and Mayr 1996) p. 18
	* This is where a "commander" joins each higher level; compare with type one plain aggregative hierarchy of Linnean system where "nothing new joins the hierarchy at any given rank. Organisms are aggregated into species, these same species are aggregated into genera, and so forth..." *without* additional 'leaders' joining as we move up the ranks.
	* Best example is the organization of armies.

## Chapter 3: Development and Bodyplans p. 76

## Chapter 4: Morphological and Molecular Phylogenies p. 115
### Assumed Evolutionary Histories Affect Morphologically Based Phylogenetic Hypotheses

### Evolutionary Histories Affect Molecularly Based Estimates of the Timing, Branching Patterns, And Order of Origins of Phyla p. 123

### Morphological And Molecular Homologies Are Decomposable p. 131

### There Is A Large Variety of Ways to Form Trees From Molecular Sequences p. 132

### Although Molecular Phylogenies Produce Conflicting Topologies, They Have Also Produced a Growing Consensus on Major Alliances of Phyla p. 138

### Combined Morphological/Molecular Phylogenies of Phyla May Require Improved Assessments of Homologies To Be Successful p. 143
