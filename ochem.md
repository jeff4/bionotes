# Organic Chemistry
* [Seventh Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-seventh-Leroy-Wade/dp/B008GATIL8) (2010) textbook by Leroy G. Wade
* EPM = [Electrostatic Potential Map](http://people.reed.edu/~alan/ACS97/elpot.html)

### Folding of peptide &#945;-helix secondary structure
* Experimentation on 7/31/2020 with molecular model kit showed specific atoms involved in hydrogen bonds that help keep the *&#945;*-helix chain in shape.
	* Per diagram on Alberts p. 134, consider **N1**-C1a-C1b-**N2**-C2a-C2b-**N3**-C3a-C3b-**N4**-C4a-C4b-**N5**-C5a-C5b-...
	* There is a hydrogen attached to N1, N2, N3, etc.; the "left-side" amide terminus of each amino acid.
	* Let *x* = 1,2,3,... There is an oxygen double-bonded to each carbon C*x*b. Aka there is a carbonyl group on the "right-side" acid terminus of each amino acid. 
	* The hydrogen at **N1** hydrogen bonds to the **oxygen at C3b**.
	* The hydrogen at **N2** hydrogen bonds to the **oxygen at C4b**.
	* The hydrogen at **N3** hydrogen bonds to the **oxygen at C5b**.
	* *and so on...*


### Isoprenes and Terpenes
* Both isoprenes and terpenes are alkenes, but derived compounds that include oxygen and other moeities are called *isoprenoids* and *terpenoids*.
* Mini-molecular model kit emphasizes that the entire isoprene unit is planar. Completely flat except for the -CH<sub>3</sub> methyl groups tetrahedral terminal hydrogens.
* [Isoprenes](http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/isoprene/isopreneh.htm) such as [2-methyl-1,3-butadiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprene) are 5-carbon subunits that are used to build up larger molecules like [terpenes](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/chemistry/c3045/client_edit/ppt/PDF/26_07_10.pdf) and ultimately steroids which are lipids.
* Each [terpene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene) has 5n carbons per the biogenetic isoprene rule *aka* the C<sub>5</sub> rule proposed in [1953](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Ružička).
* See also Alberts 5th Edition p. 115 and JH notes from 7/28/2020 and Khan Academy [lectures 1](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/organ-systems/endocrine-system/v/terpenes-to-steroids1) and [2](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/organ-systems/endocrine-system/v/terpenes-to-steroids2) on terpenes and steroids.

* Note that hydrocarbons are divided into [aliphatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliphatic_compound) versus aromatic subcategories. 
	* **Aromatic** hydrocarbons include benzene and other resonant ring-structures. 
	* **Aliphatic** aka non-aromatic hydrocarbons include straight chain alkanes like hexane as well as cyclic (non-resonant) molecules like cyclohexane. Aliphatic hydrocarbons can be saturated or unsaturated.
