# Organic Chemistry
* [Seventh Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-seventh-Leroy-Wade/dp/B008GATIL8) (2010) textbook by Leroy G. Wade
* EPM = [Electrostatic Potential Map](http://people.reed.edu/~alan/ACS97/elpot.html)

### Folding of peptide &#945;-helix secondary structure
* Experimentation on 7/31/2020 with molecular model kit showed specific atoms involved in hydrogen bonds that help keep the *&#945;*-helix chain in shape.
	* Per diagram on Alberts p. 134, consider **N1**-C1a-C1b-**N2**-C2a-C2b-**N3**-C3a-C3b-**N4**-C4a-C4b-**N5**-C5a-C5b-...
	* There is a hydrogen attached to N1, N2, N3, etc.; the "left-side" amide terminus of each amino acid.
	* Let *x* = 1,2,3,... There is an oxygen double-bonded to each carbon C*x*b. Aka there is a carbonyl group on the "right-side" acid terminus of each amino acid. 
	* The hydrogen at **N1** hydrogen bonds to the **oxygen at C3b**.
	* The hydrogen at **N2** hydrogen bonds to the **oxygen at C4b**.
	* The hydrogen at **N3** hydrogen bonds to the **oxygen at C5b**.
	* *and so on...*


### Isoprenes and Terpenes
* Both isoprenes and terpenes are alkenes, but derived compounds that include oxygen and other moeities are called *isoprenoids* and *terpenoids*.
* Mini-molecular model kit emphasizes that the entire isoprene unit is planar. Completely flat except for the -CH<sub>3</sub> methyl groups tetrahedral terminal hydrogens.
* [Isoprenes](http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/isoprene/isopreneh.htm) such as [2-methyl-1,3-butadiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprene) are 5-carbon subunits that are used to build up larger molecules like [terpenes](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/chemistry/c3045/client_edit/ppt/PDF/26_07_10.pdf) and ultimately steroids which are lipids.
* Each [terpene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene) has 5n carbons per the biogenetic isoprene rule *aka* the C<sub>5</sub> rule proposed in [1953](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Ružička).
* See also Alberts 5th Edition p. 115 and JH notes from 7/28/2020 and Khan Academy [lectures 1](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/organ-systems/endocrine-system/v/terpenes-to-steroids1) and [2](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/organ-systems/endocrine-system/v/terpenes-to-steroids2) on terpenes and steroids.

	* **Aromatic** hydrocarbons include benzene and other resonant ring-structures. 
	* **Aliphatic** aka non-aromatic hydrocarbons include straight chain alkanes like hexane as well as cyclic (non-resonant) molecules like cyclohexane. Aliphatic hydrocarbons can be saturated or unsaturated.

* **See p. 13 for a very important table** to see common charges on atoms in organic compounds and ions. See also handwritten JH notes 10/23/2020
* See Wade p. 15 for example of **H<sub>2</sub>C=NH<sub>2</sub>** which is a [Primary Aldimine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imine#Nomenclature_and_classification), a type of [**imine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imine) b/c there is a C=N double bond.
* Problem 1-8f on p. 17 refers to [**formamide** aka **methanamide**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formamide) which has the chemical structure **HC(=O)NH<sub>2</sub>**.

#### Bond-Dipole moments (p. 59-60)
* LG Wade, Chapter 2, Section 2-9A (10/11/2020)
* Range of bond polarities from least to most polar: covalent (non-polar with similar electronegativities), covalent (polar which occurs when the 2 atoms have very different electronegativity), to totally ionic.
* List from least polar (aka most non-polar) to most polar:
	* ethane – CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>
	* methylamine – CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>
	* methanol – CH<sub>3</sub>OH
	* chloromethane – CH<sub>3</sub>Cl
	* methylammonium chloride (ionic bond):  CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>
* Bond polarity is measured by the [**bond dipole moment &#956;**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_dipole_moment) ("mu"), which is measured by &#956; = **&#948;** * **d** where **&#948;** = amount of charge either end fo the dipole and **d** = distance between the charges.
* The usual unit for bond polarity is the [debye, abbreviated "D"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debye) where **1 D** = ~3.336 * 10<sup>-30</sup> Coulomb*meters.
* In organic compounds, bond dipole moments range from zero (for symmetrically equal electronegativities) to about 3.6D for the very polarized C&#8801;N triple bond.
* See p. 60, Table 2-1 for a list of common 2-atom bond dipole moments

### Chapter 3: Structure and Stereochemistry of Alkanes p. 83–126
* [Methylene groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_group) are simply interior **–CH<sub>2</sub>–** groups. p. 84
* Methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, etc. are all [homologs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(chemistry)).
* Four Rules of Naming Alkanes per [IUPAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry):
	1. The Main Chain
	2. Numbering the Main Chain
	3. Naming the Alkyl Group
	4. Organizing Multiple Groups
* **Geometric isomers** of cycloalkanes. A cycloalkane has two distinct faces. If substituent groups point towards the same face, they are **cis**. If the groups are oriented towards opposite faces, they are **trans**.  p. 105

### Chapter 4: Chemical Reactions p. 127-168
* Start with halogenation of alkanes
* Mechanism, thermodynamics, and kinetics p. 128
	1. Mechanism – step by step series of intermediates from reactants to final product(s)
	2. Thermodynamics – study of free energy changes, entropy, enthalpy
	3. Kinetics – study of speed of reaction (aka reaction rates) based on conditions

#### Section 4.3: The Free-Radical Chain Reaction
* Chain reaction mechanism has 3 types of steps:
	1. Initiation step
	2. Propagation steps
	3. Termination steps
