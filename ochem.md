### Folding of peptide &#945;-helix secondary structure
* Experimentation on 7/31/2020 with molecular model kit showed specific atoms involved in hydrogen bonds that help keep the *&#945;*-helix chain in shape.
	* Per diagram on Alberts p. 134, consider **N1**-C1a-C1b-**N2**-C2a-C2b-**N3**-C3a-C3b-**N4**-C4a-C4b-**N5**-C5a-C5b-...
	* There is a hydrogen attached to N1, N2, N3, etc.; the "left-side" amide terminus of each amino acid.
	* Let *x* = 1,2,3,... There is an oxygen double-bonded to each carbon C*x*b. Aka there is a carbonyl group on the "right-side" acid terminus of each amino acid. 
	* The hydrogen at **N1** hydrogen bonds to the **oxygen at C3b**.
	* The hydrogen at **N2** hydrogen bonds to the **oxygen at C4b**.
	* The hydrogen at **N3** hydrogen bonds to the **oxygen at C5b**.
	* *and so on...*

| 11             | undecane | 1-undecene              | 1-undecyne             |

* Note that hydrocarbons are divided into [aliphatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliphatic_compound) versus aromatic subcategories. 
	* **Aromatic** hydrocarbons include benzene and other resonant ring-structures. 
	* **Aliphatic** aka non-aromatic hydrocarbons include straight chain alkanes like hexane as well as cyclic (non-resonant) molecules like cyclohexane. Aliphatic hydrocarbons can be saturated or unsaturated.
	
#### Resonance-stabilization and resonance hybrids
* Wade p. 13-16
* See also <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Oregon_Institute_of_Technology/OIT%3A_CHE_332_--_Organic_Chemistry_II_(Lund)/9%3A_Phosphate_Transfer_Reactions/02%3A_Overview_of_Phosphate_Groups">this page</a> and Wayne Breslyn's short and very clear [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQxL-2q0Pac) about the hybrid structure **phosophate ion PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>**
* **See p. 13 for a very important table** to see common charges on atoms in organic compounds and ions. See also handwritten JH notes 10/23/2020
* See Wade p. 15 for example of **H<sub>2</sub>C=NH<sub>2</sub>** which is a [Primary Aldimine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imine#Nomenclature_and_classification), a type of [**imine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imine) b/c there is a C=N double bond.
* Problem 1-8f on p. 17 refers to [**formamide** aka **methanamide**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formamide) which has the chemical structure **HC(=O)NH<sub>2</sub>**.

#### Bond-Dipole moments (p. 59-60)
* LG Wade, Chapter 2, Section 2-9A (10/11/2020)
* Range of bond polarities from least to most polar: covalent (non-polar with similar electronegativities), covalent (polar which occurs when the 2 atoms have very different electronegativity), to totally ionic.
* List from least polar (aka most non-polar) to most polar:
	* ethane – CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>
	* methylamine – CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>
	* methanol – CH<sub>3</sub>OH
	* chloromethane – CH<sub>3</sub>Cl
	* methylammonium chloride (ionic bond):  CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>
* Bond polarity is measured by the [**bond dipole moment &#956;**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_dipole_moment) ("mu"), which is measured by &#956; = **&#948;** * **d** where **&#948;** = amount of charge either end fo the dipole and **d** = distance between the charges.
* The usual unit for bond polarity is the [debye, abbreviated "D"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debye) where **1 D** = ~3.336 * 10<sup>-30</sup> Coulomb*meters.
* In organic compounds, bond dipole moments range from zero (for symmetrically equal electronegativities) to about 3.6D for the very polarized C&#8801;N triple bond.
* See p. 60, Table 2-1 for a list of common 2-atom bond dipole moments

### Chapter 3: Structure and Stereochemistry of Alkanes p. 83–126
* [Methylene groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_group) are simply interior **–CH<sub>2</sub>–** groups. p. 84
* Methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, etc. are all [homologs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(chemistry)).
* Four Rules of Naming Alkanes per [IUPAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry):
	1. The Main Chain
	2. Numbering the Main Chain
	3. Naming the Alkyl Group
	4. Organizing Multiple Groups
* **Geometric isomers** of cycloalkanes. A cycloalkane has two distinct faces. If substituent groups point towards the same face, they are **cis**. If the groups are oriented towards opposite faces, they are **trans**.  p. 105

### Chapter 4: Chemical Reactions p. 127-168
* Start with halogenation of alkanes
* Mechanism, thermodynamics, and kinetics p. 128
	1. Mechanism – step by step series of intermediates from reactants to final product(s)
	2. Thermodynamics – study of free energy changes, entropy, enthalpy
	3. Kinetics – study of speed of reaction (aka reaction rates) based on conditions
* Thermodynamics is relatively static, based on overall change in Gibbs Free energy, change in BDE (bond dissassociation enthalpies) aka heat aka enthalpy changes, and change in entropy at a given temperature. No calculus needed. Concentration equation can be based on stoichiometry (I think).
* In contrast, Kinetics and the rate equation is related to concentrations which various continuously over time. In other words, for a forward reaction with suffcient product available, the rate of reaction is varying continuously because the concentration of reactants is presumably decreasing while the concnetration of products is presumably increasing. See [this PDF for example](https://laney.edu/abraham-reyes/wp-content/uploads/sites/229/2015/08/Differential-and-Integrated-Rate-Laws1.pdf).

##### More detail on rate laws
* From [Laney.edu PDF](https://laney.edu/abraham-reyes/wp-content/uploads/sites/229/2015/08/Differential-and-Integrated-Rate-Laws1.pdf)
* Differential rate laws:
	* Express the rate of reaction as a function of a change in the concentration of one or more reactants over a particular period of time
	* Describe what is happening at the molecular level during a reaction
	* **Rate = -d[*A*] / dt = k[*A*]<sup>n</sup>**
* Integrated rate laws:
	* Express the rate of reacgion as a function of the initial conentration of *A* and the measured (actual)  one or more reactants after a specific amount of time has passed
	* Used to determine the rate constant and reaction order from experimental data
	* **ln[*A*] = -kt + ln[*A*]<sub>0</sub>** where [*A*]<sub>0</sub> is  concentration of reactant *A* at the very beginning and [*A*] is the concentration of *A* after time t has passed.
* Zeroth order reactions (n = 0)
* First order reactions (n=1)
* Second order reactions (n=2)

#### Section 4.3: The Free-Radical Chain Reaction
* Chain reaction mechanism has 3 types of steps:
	1. Initiation step
	2. Propagation steps
	3. Termination steps  

### Chapter 5: Stereochemistry p. 169-214
#### Section 5-2A: Chirality and Enantiomerism in Organic Molecules
* Every object has a mirror image. If that mirror image can be super-imposed on the original, then that object is *achiral* and therefore has no enantiomers.
* If the mirror-image demonstrates handedness, aka, cannot be super-imposed on the original, then that object is *chiral* and has enantiomers.
* There are two broad classes of isomers:
	1. **Constitutional isomers** aka structural isomers which have the same atoms but a different bonding sequence.
	2. **Stereoisomers** which have the same atoms *and* the same bonding sequence. However, such stereoisomers may exhibit chirality aka handedness.
* Chapter 5 is about the second broad class: stereoisomers. Stereoisomers consist of: (1) [**geometric isomers**](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/wsmcneil/ccgeoiso.htm) and (2) **enantiomers** but we will focus primarily on enantiomers.
* Per [this article](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/wsmcneil/enants.htm), *enantiomers are different than other isomers*. Most isomers display distinct physical and chemical properties from each other. However, a pair of enantiomers have identical physical and chemical proprties *except* when it comes to interacting with other chiral objects.

#### Section 5-3: (R) and (S) Nomenclature of Asymmetric Carbon Atoms
* The [Cahn-Ingold-Prelog convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn–Ingold–Prelog_priority_rules) aka *CIP priority* rules aka *CIP system* is a standard process to completely and unequivocally name a stereoisomer of a molecule. The purpose of the CIP system is to assign an R or S descriptior to each stereocenter and an E or Z descriptor to each double bond.
* Rules [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn–Ingold–Prelog_priority_rules):
	1. Identify stereocenters and double bonds
	1. Assign priorities to the groups attached to each stereocenter or double-bonded atom
	1. Assign R/S descriptors and E/Z descriptors

#### Section 5-4: R/S Nomenclature Is Independent of Dextrorotatory / Levorotatory (Optical Activity and Polarimetry)
* From <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Organic_Chemistry_with_a_Biological_Emphasis_v2.0_(Soderberg)/03%3A_Conformations_and_Stereochemistry/3.06%3A_Optical_Activity">Chem Libre Text</a>, "**There is no relationship between chiral compound's R/S designation and the direction of its specific rotation.** For example, the S enantiomer of ibuprofen is dextrorotatory, but the S enantiomer of glyceraldehyde is levorotatory."
* See also <a href="https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Biochemistry/Book%3A_Biochemistry_Online_(Jakubowski)/02%3A_PROTEIN_STRUCTURE/2A%3A_Amino_Acids/A02._Amino_Acid_Stereochemistry">this good explanation</a> of why biochemists prefer to use the older D/L system. It's more relevant to the nature of what they study.
* For a simplistic mneumonic using the CORN law which ignores R/S and focuses only on D/L, [see this page](http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/education/AminoAcid/stereochem.html).  Virtually all biologically occurring amino acids are levorotatory with the exception of glycine which is achiral (b/c the side-chain is a simple hydrogen atom).

### Chapter 6: Alkyl Halides: Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination p. 215-280

#### Section 6-10: Factors Affecting S<sub>N</sub>2 Reactions: Strength of the Nucleophile p. 233-235
* A base is always stronger than it's corresponding conjugate acid
* We might be tempted to say that methoxide CH<sub>3</sub>OH is more nucleophilic because it is a strong base. But this is a *spurious* correlation! p. 234
	* In fact, basicity and nucleophilicity are *distinct* properties. In the cases of: (1) a base stealing a proton H<sup>+</sup> and (2) a nucleophile attaching to a central carbon, we see a two *different* types of new bond formation. If the new bond is to a hydrogen/proton, then the reagant is acting as a **base**. if the new bond is to a central carbon in the substrate, the reagant is acting as a **nucleophile**. 
	* **Basicity** is the equilibrium constant K<sub>eq</sub> for abstacting a proton H<sup>+</sup>.
	* **Nucleophilicity** is defined as the *rate* (*k<sub>r</sub>*) by which a nucleophile attacks a substrate electrophilic carbon atom.
* Three trends affecting the how strong the nucleophile is (p. 234-235). 
	1. The negative charged species (anion form) is a stronger nucleophile than the non-charged (neutral atomic/molecular form)
	2. Within the neutral/anionic right half of the periodic table, elements to the left (e.g., Group 15) are *more* nucleophilic because they are *less* electronegative than elements to the right (e.g., Group 16-17). So NH<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> is more nucleophilic than OH<sup>-</sup> which is more nucleophilic than F<sup>-</sup>. Because F is more electronegative than O and N. (see bullet below for explanation).
	3. Within a Group/column, the further down in the periodic table one goes, the less electronegative and therefore the *more* nucleophilic the element. At the same time, atomic radii is also increasing the further down a column one goes which also helps with nucleophilicity because of a bigger electron cloud that can reach out an attach for S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions.
* Note, the more electronegative an element is, the *less* nucleophilic it is (assuming it still has a net negative rather than  positive charge). At first, this may seem contradictory because negatively charged anions (e.g., halide ions like F<sup>-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>, I<sup>-</sup>) act as nucleophiles much more than positively charged cations (e.g., alkali metals like Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>). However, *given* a  neutral or negative species, within that grouping, oddly enough the less electrophilc an element, the stronger a nucleophile it is! So moving left to right in Period 2, N is more nucleophilic than O which is more nucleophilic than F which is the opposite of electronegativity. N is less electronegative than O is less electronegative than F. This is because the more electronegative an element is, the more tightly its nucleus grips its electron cloud. So the electron cloud is smaller and tighter and less likely to be able to do backside attachment to the target substrate carbon atom.

	* Also researched relationship between methionine and [S-adenosylmethionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Adenosyl_methionine) aka SAM-e aka Ado-Met aka SAM.  Seems like SAM-e is a co-substrate in methyl group transfers, transsulfuration, and aminopropylation. 
	* According to the SAM-e wiki article, 
		* "SAM-e is bound by the SAM riboswitch which regulates genes involved in methionine and cysteine biosynthesis."  
		* "In eukaryotic cells, SAM-e serves as a regulator of...DNA methylation, tRNA methylation, and rRNA methylation; immune response, amino acid metabolism."

	* From this [2019 article](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/molecule-of-the-week/archive/t/tetracene.html):
		* "It is the second member of the “acene” family of linearly arranged PAHs that begins with anthracene and continues to pentacene, hexacene, and beyond. The bright orange molecule is also known as naphthacene, 2,3-benzanthracene, and benz[b]anthracene. 
		* "Unlike many PAHs, tetracene is not carcinogenic. But it was studied for carcinogenicity as long ago as the 1930s. Early researchers were James W. Cook and co-workers at the Cancer Hospital of London and Alfred Winterstein and Karl Schön at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research1 (Heidelberg, Germany).
		* "Not much was done with tetracene until 2007, when researchers discovered that it is a semiconductor that was useful in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). This year, electrical engineer Marc A. Baldo at MIT (Cambridge, MA) and colleagues there and at Princeton University (NJ) incorporated it into silicon solar cells (SSCs).

		* 3 Polar, Postively Charged AA (PPC): Lysine, Histidine, Arginine (all have Nitrogens). 
		* 2 Polar, Negatively Charged AA (PNegC): The two acids aspartic acid, glutamic acid.
	* On Friday:
		* 4 Polar, Uncharged AA: Serine, Threonine, Asparagine, Glutamine
	* On Saturday: 
		* 3 special cases: Glycine (just hydrogen so the only achiral AA). Proline which has amine ring attached to the nitrogen; only one side chain which connects to peptide backbone; used in 2021 Nobel work on organocatalysts. Cysteine.
* 10/9 Posted about Aspartic Acid. Started reading about Glutamic Acid / glutamate / monosodium glutamate MSG. History of food, role in nervous system with GABA inhibitory / exitatory system etc.
* 10/10 posted about Glutamic Acid / Glutamate. This is a good 2020 article about [the GABA inhibitory system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513311/). Of course, glutamate is an important neurotransmitter for excitatory networks.
* 10/11 Posted about Lysine. [Good article](http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/aa/lysine.html) about epsilon-amino group NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> in physiological conditions.
* 10/12 Posted about Arginine. [Good article](http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/aa/Arginine.html) about guanidino group that at physiological pH, becomes a [charged guanidinium cation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanidine#Guanidinium_cation).
* 10/13 posted histidine which has a [5 member, 2-nitrogen Imidazole Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazole) in uncharged state which converts at physiological pH to zwitterion / positive cation as an [Imidazolium Ring](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/imidazolium). As usual, Arizona has good page of the [zwitterion form of histidine](http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/aa/histidine.html).
	* Hm, i think i'll start posting at like 10 PM Pacific time and then go to sleep. Post for the next day basically.
	* Here's the list of AA's so far: 8 nonpolar/hydrophobic: alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine; phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan. 2 polar negatively charged: aspartic acid, glutamic acid. 3 polar negatively charged: lysine, arginine, histidine. Next 4: serine, threonine, asparagine, GLUTAMINE WHICH IS NOT YET PHOTGRAPHED!
		* And then the final three: glycine, proline, cysteine.
* 10/14 posted Serine
* 10/15 posted Threonine. spent some time writing handwritten notes for IG Stories.
	* Read about distinction between [ligands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand) (and see also [biochemical ligands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry))), [C2-Symmetric Ligands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C2-Symmetric_ligands),  [functional groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group), and [moieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moiety_(chemistry)) OR [substituent groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituent) around a central carbon.
* 10/16 set up Excel checklist planning for next week of posts
	* Cysteine info
		* [Important point in wikipedia about how cysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine) provides the only R stereocenter (for the alpha-carbon i believe). Whereas all other amino acids have an S-stereocenter there. Quote: "Cysteine has l chirality in the older d/l notation based on homology to d- and l-glyceraldehyde. In the newer R/S system of designating chirality, based on the atomic numbers of atoms near the asymmetric carbon, cysteine (and selenocysteine) have R chirality, because of the presence of sulfur (or selenium) as a second neighbour to the asymmetric carbon atom. The remaining chiral amino acids, having lighter atoms in that position, have S chirality."
		* Additional [good points at Arizona about cysteine](http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/aa/cysteine.html), structural similarity but chemical/functional differences compared to serine (simple OH alcohol) where O is replaced by S sulfur.
	* Proline info
		* [From Arizona](http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/aa/Proline.html), Proline is technically not an amino acid but an imino acid
		* From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proline), 'The "side chain" from the α carbon connects to the nitrogen forming a pyrrolidine loop, classifying it as a aliphatic amino acid'
* 10/17 more research on glutamine.
	* 2001 Introductory to the Symposium Proceedings remarks for the conference: Glutamine Metabolism: Nutritional and Clinical Significance by Douglas W. Wilmore and John L. Rombeau.
	* Hans Krebs 1980 Paper <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0rq5VC8nYesC&lpg=PA319&ots=uG7SGcDYeZ&dq=Krebs%2C%20H.%20(1980)%20Special%20lecture%3A%20glutamine%20metabolism%20in%20the%20animal%20body.%20In%3A%20Glutamine%20Metabolism%20Enzymology%20and%20Regulation&lr&pg=PA327#v=onepage&q&f=false">"Special Lecture: Glutamine Metabolism in the Animal Body" </a>where he says at the end of the lecture: "Finally a few comments on the multiplicity of the functions of gluatmine....Most amino acids have multiple functions (Table III) but glutamine appears to be the most versatile."
* 10/18 Glycine, first of the 3 specials. posted Sunday evening for Monday. then did stories for Monday.
	* Cysteine is the only R- configured amino acid. All amino acids are Levorotary under the old D/L system. And 19 of the 20 amino acids are also S-configured around the cenrtral alpha carbon *except* cysteine because of the presence of the sulfur atom right next to the beta-carbon. Good youtube video here titled Amino Acid Stereochemistry R and S vs. D and L Configuration. [Start at about 17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG4bqgGR3DI&t=1147s)
