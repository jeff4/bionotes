| Hydroxyl<br>**-OH**                | *Alcohols* like ethanol                       | Polar. Hydrogen bonds with water to help dissolve molecules. Enables linkage to other molecules by deydration/condensation synthesis reaction         |
| [Aldehyde (carbonyl) group](http://dept.harpercollege.edu/chemistry/chm/100/dgodambe/thedisk/qual/9back6.htm)<br>**H-C=O**             | *Aldehydes* like Acetalaldehyde                              | Very reactive and important in building molecules and energy-releasing reactions                                                                      |

[Usually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester) derived from combining a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.   |
| [Carboxyl group](https://byjus.com/chemistry/carboxyl-group/)<br>**-COOH**              | *Carboxylic acids* like [acetic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid)           | Acidic. Ionizes in living tissues to form -COO<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>. Enters dehydration/condensation reactions by giving up -OH.             |
| [Amino group](https://byjus.com/chemistry/amines/)<br>**-NH<sub>2</sub>**       | *Amines* like methylamine                     | Basic. Accepts H<sup>+</sup> in living tissues to form -NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>. Enters dehydration synthesis reactions by giving up H<sup>+</sup> |
| [Phosophate group](http://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/IGOC/P/phosphate_group.html)<br>R-**PO<sub>4</sub>** | *Organic phosophates* like 3-phosphoglycerate | Acidic. Enters dehydration synthesis reactions by giving up -OH. Hydrolysis releases a lot of energy when bonded to another phosphate.                |
| [Sulfhydryl group](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Organic_Chemistry/Organic_Functional_Group/Sulfhydryl)<br>R-**SH**            | *Thiols* like mercaptoethanol                 | Two -SH groups can each give up H and form a disulfide bridge that stabilizes protein structure.                                                      |
