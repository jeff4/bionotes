# Organic Chemistry
* [Seventh Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-seventh-Leroy-Wade/dp/B008GATIL8) (2010) textbook by Leroy G. Wade
* EPM = [Electrostatic Potential Map](http://people.reed.edu/~alan/ACS97/elpot.html)

### Folding of peptide &#945;-helix secondary structure
* Experimentation on 7/31/2020 with molecular model kit showed specific atoms involved in hydrogen bonds that help keep the *&#945;*-helix chain in shape.
	* Per diagram on Alberts p. 134, consider **N1**-C1a-C1b-**N2**-C2a-C2b-**N3**-C3a-C3b-**N4**-C4a-C4b-**N5**-C5a-C5b-...
	* There is a hydrogen attached to N1, N2, N3, etc.; the "left-side" amide terminus of each amino acid.
	* Let *x* = 1,2,3,... There is an oxygen double-bonded to each carbon C*x*b. Aka there is a carbonyl group on the "right-side" acid terminus of each amino acid. 
	* The hydrogen at **N1** hydrogen bonds to the **oxygen at C3b**.
	* The hydrogen at **N2** hydrogen bonds to the **oxygen at C4b**.
	* The hydrogen at **N3** hydrogen bonds to the **oxygen at C5b**.
	* *and so on...*


### Isoprenes and Terpenes
* Both isoprenes and terpenes are alkenes, but derived compounds that include oxygen and other moeities are called *isoprenoids* and *terpenoids*.
* Mini-molecular model kit emphasizes that the entire isoprene unit is planar. Completely flat except for the -CH<sub>3</sub> methyl groups tetrahedral terminal hydrogens.
* [Isoprenes](http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/isoprene/isopreneh.htm) such as [2-methyl-1,3-butadiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprene) are 5-carbon subunits that are used to build up larger molecules like [terpenes](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/chemistry/c3045/client_edit/ppt/PDF/26_07_10.pdf) and ultimately steroids which are lipids.
* Each [terpene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene) has 5n carbons per the biogenetic isoprene rule *aka* the C<sub>5</sub> rule proposed in [1953](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Ružička).
* See also Alberts 5th Edition p. 115 and JH notes from 7/28/2020 and Khan Academy [lectures 1](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/organ-systems/endocrine-system/v/terpenes-to-steroids1) and [2](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/organ-systems/endocrine-system/v/terpenes-to-steroids2) on terpenes and steroids.

* Note that hydrocarbons are divided into [aliphatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliphatic_compound) versus aromatic subcategories. 
	* **Aromatic** hydrocarbons include benzene and other resonant ring-structures. 
	* **Aliphatic** aka non-aromatic hydrocarbons include straight chain alkanes like hexane as well as cyclic (non-resonant) molecules like cyclohexane. Aliphatic hydrocarbons can be saturated or unsaturated.
	
#### Resonance-stabilization and resonance hybrids

* **See p. 13 for a very important table** to see common charges on atoms in organic compounds and ions. See also handwritten JH notes 10/23/2020
* See Wade p. 15 for example of **H<sub>2</sub>C=NH<sub>2</sub>** which is a [Primary Aldimine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imine#Nomenclature_and_classification), a type of [**imine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imine) b/c there is a C=N double bond.
* Problem 1-8f on p. 17 refers to [**formamide** aka **methanamide**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formamide) which has the chemical structure **HC(=O)NH<sub>2</sub>**.

#### Bond-Dipole moments (p. 59-60)
* LG Wade, Chapter 2, Section 2-9A (10/11/2020)
* Range of bond polarities from least to most polar: covalent (non-polar with similar electronegativities), covalent (polar which occurs when the 2 atoms have very different electronegativity), to totally ionic.
* List from least polar (aka most non-polar) to most polar:
	* ethane – CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>
	* methylamine – CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>
	* methanol – CH<sub>3</sub>OH
	* chloromethane – CH<sub>3</sub>Cl
	* methylammonium chloride (ionic bond):  CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>
* Bond polarity is measured by the [**bond dipole moment &#956;**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_dipole_moment) ("mu"), which is measured by &#956; = **&#948;** * **d** where **&#948;** = amount of charge either end fo the dipole and **d** = distance between the charges.
* The usual unit for bond polarity is the [debye, abbreviated "D"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debye) where **1 D** = ~3.336 * 10<sup>-30</sup> Coulomb*meters.
* In organic compounds, bond dipole moments range from zero (for symmetrically equal electronegativities) to about 3.6D for the very polarized C&#8801;N triple bond.
* See p. 60, Table 2-1 for a list of common 2-atom bond dipole moments

### Chapter 3: Structure and Stereochemistry of Alkanes p. 83–126
* [Methylene groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_group) are simply interior **–CH<sub>2</sub>–** groups. p. 84
* Methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, etc. are all [homologs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(chemistry)).
* Four Rules of Naming Alkanes per [IUPAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry):
	1. The Main Chain
	2. Numbering the Main Chain
	3. Naming the Alkyl Group
	4. Organizing Multiple Groups
* **Geometric isomers** of cycloalkanes. A cycloalkane has two distinct faces. If substituent groups point towards the same face, they are **cis**. If the groups are oriented towards opposite faces, they are **trans**.  p. 105

### Chapter 4: Chemical Reactions p. 127-168
* Start with halogenation of alkanes
* Mechanism, thermodynamics, and kinetics p. 128
	1. Mechanism – step by step series of intermediates from reactants to final product(s)
	2. Thermodynamics – study of free energy changes, entropy, enthalpy
	3. Kinetics – study of speed of reaction (aka reaction rates) based on conditions
* Thermodynamics is relatively static, based on overall change in Gibbs Free energy, change in BDE (bond dissassociation enthalpies) aka heat aka enthalpy changes, and change in entropy at a given temperature. No calculus needed. Concentration equation can be based on stoichiometry (I think).
* In contrast, Kinetics and the rate equation is related to concentrations which various continuously over time. In other words, for a forward reaction with suffcient product available, the rate of reaction is varying continuously because the concentration of reactants is presumably decreasing while the concnetration of products is presumably increasing. See [this PDF for example](https://laney.edu/abraham-reyes/wp-content/uploads/sites/229/2015/08/Differential-and-Integrated-Rate-Laws1.pdf).

##### More detail on rate laws
* From [Laney.edu PDF](https://laney.edu/abraham-reyes/wp-content/uploads/sites/229/2015/08/Differential-and-Integrated-Rate-Laws1.pdf)
* Differential rate laws:
	* Express the rate of reaction as a function of a change in the concentration of one or more reactants over a particular period of time
	* Describe what is happening at the molecular level during a reaction
	* **Rate = -d[*A*] / dt = k[*A*]<sup>n</sup>**
* Integrated rate laws:
	* Express the rate of reacgion as a function of the initial conentration of *A* and the measured (actual)  one or more reactants after a specific amount of time has passed
	* Used to determine the rate constant and reaction order from experimental data
	* **ln[*A*] = -kt + ln[*A*]<sub>0</sub>** where [*A*]<sub>0</sub> is  concentration of reactant *A* at the very beginning and [*A*] is the concentration of *A* after time t has passed.
* Zeroth order reactions (n = 0)
* First order reactions (n=1)
* Second order reactions (n=2)

#### Section 4.3: The Free-Radical Chain Reaction
* Chain reaction mechanism has 3 types of steps:
	1. Initiation step
	2. Propagation steps
	3. Termination steps  

### Chapter 5: Stereochemistry p. 169-214
#### Section 5-2A: Chirality and Enantiomerism in Organic Molecules
* Every object has a mirror image. If that mirror image can be super-imposed on the original, then that object is *achiral* and therefore has no enantiomers.
* If the mirror-image demonstrates handedness, aka, cannot be super-imposed on the original, then that object is *chiral* and has enantiomers.
* There are two broad classes of isomers:
	1. **Constitutional isomers** aka structural isomers which have the same atoms but a different bonding sequence.
	2. **Stereoisomers** which have the same atoms *and* the same bonding sequence. However, such stereoisomers may exhibit chirality aka handedness.
* Chapter 5 is about the second broad class: stereoisomers. Stereoisomers consist of: (1) [**geometric isomers**](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/wsmcneil/ccgeoiso.htm) and (2) **enantiomers** but we will focus primarily on enantiomers.
* Per [this article](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/wsmcneil/enants.htm), *enantiomers are different than other isomers*. Most isomers display distinct physical and chemical properties from each other. However, a pair of enantiomers have identical physical and chemical proprties *except* when it comes to interacting with other chiral objects.

#### Section 5-3: (R) and (S) Nomenclature of Asymmetric Carbon Atoms
* The [Cahn-Ingold-Prelog convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn–Ingold–Prelog_priority_rules) aka *CIP priority* rules aka *CIP system* is a standard process to completely and unequivocally name a stereoisomer of a molecule. The purpose of the CIP system is to assign an R or S descriptior to each stereocenter and an E or Z descriptor to each double bond.
* Rules [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn–Ingold–Prelog_priority_rules):
	1. Identify stereocenters and double bonds
	1. Assign priorities to the groups attached to each stereocenter or double-bonded atom
	1. Assign R/S descriptors and E/Z descriptors

#### Section 5-4: R/S Nomenclature Is Independent of Dextrorotatory / Levorotatory (Optical Activity and Polarimetry)
* From <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Organic_Chemistry_with_a_Biological_Emphasis_v2.0_(Soderberg)/03%3A_Conformations_and_Stereochemistry/3.06%3A_Optical_Activity">Chem Libre Text</a>, "**There is no relationship between chiral compound's R/S designation and the direction of its specific rotation.** For example, the S enantiomer of ibuprofen is dextrorotatory, but the S enantiomer of glyceraldehyde is levorotatory."
* See also <a href="https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Biochemistry/Book%3A_Biochemistry_Online_(Jakubowski)/02%3A_PROTEIN_STRUCTURE/2A%3A_Amino_Acids/A02._Amino_Acid_Stereochemistry">this good explanation</a> of why biochemists prefer to use the older D/L system. It's more relevant to the nature of what they study.
* For a simplistic mneumonic using the CORN law which ignores R/S and focuses only on D/L, [see this page](http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/education/AminoAcid/stereochem.html).  Virtually all biologically occurring amino acids are levorotatory with the exception of glycine which is achiral (b/c the side-chain is a simple hydrogen atom).

	* Also researched relationship between methionine and [S-adenosylmethionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Adenosyl_methionine) aka SAM-e aka Ado-Met aka SAM.  Seems like SAM-e is a co-substrate in methyl group transfers, transsulfuration, and aminopropylation. 
	* According to the SAM-e wiki article, 
		* "SAM-e is bound by the SAM riboswitch which regulates genes involved in methionine and cysteine biosynthesis."  
		* "In eukaryotic cells, SAM-e serves as a regulator of...DNA methylation, tRNA methylation, and rRNA methylation; immune response, amino acid metabolism."
		* "In plants 
		* See also [DNA methyltransferase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase) aka DNA MTase aka DNMT which transfers methyl groups to DNA.

	* Appearance is yellow-orange to red-orange crystals or powder.
	* [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/tetracene)
	* From this [2019 article](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/molecule-of-the-week/archive/t/tetracene.html):
		* "It is the second member of the “acene” family of linearly arranged PAHs that begins with anthracene and continues to pentacene, hexacene, and beyond. The bright orange molecule is also known as naphthacene, 2,3-benzanthracene, and benz[b]anthracene. 
		* "Unlike many PAHs, tetracene is not carcinogenic. But it was studied for carcinogenicity as long ago as the 1930s. Early researchers were James W. Cook and co-workers at the Cancer Hospital of London and Alfred Winterstein and Karl Schön at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research1 (Heidelberg, Germany).
		* "Not much was done with tetracene until 2007, when researchers discovered that it is a semiconductor that was useful in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). This year, electrical engineer Marc A. Baldo at MIT (Cambridge, MA) and colleagues there and at Princeton University (NJ) incorporated it into silicon solar cells (SSCs).
