## Chapter 3: Macromolecules I - Proteins, Carbohydrates, Lipids (p. 39-61)
* Four kinds of macromolecules: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids
* Macromolecular polymers are made of different types of monomers:
	* Proteins are made up of **amino acid** monomers.
	* Carbohydrates are made up of simple **sugar** monomers.
	* Lipids are made up of lipid monomers connected by *noncovalent bonds*
* In general, only polymers with molecular weights > 1000 are considered macromolecules.
* Figure 3.1 (p. 40) has a good diagram of various functional groups, categories of compounds, and example compounds.
* Figure 3.3 (p. 41) has good % breakdown of macromolecules in living tissue.
* Reactants Monomer<sub>1</sub> + ... + Monomer<sub>n</sub> --> Polymer via removal of H<sub>2</sub>0 and addition of energy (endothermic reaction). Also called **condensation** or **dehydration reaction**.
* Reverse reaction of Reactant Polymer ---> breaking into smaller monomers by adding water and releasing energy from the reactant  (exothermic reaction). Called **hydrolysis**.

### Proteins
* The protein alphabet of monomers cosists of 20 amino acids. All proteins consist of a permutation of these 20 elemental units. 
	* The smaller limit of proteins is around **51 amino acids** for *[insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin)* with molecular weight of 5,733.
	* The upper limit of protein chain size is around **27,000 amino acid** for the muscle protein *[titin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titin)* with a molecular weight of almost 3 million.
* Polypeptide chains are linear (*aka* unbranched) sequences of covalently linked amino acids.
* Amino acids have 3 functional groups plus 1 hydrogen surrounding the central *&#945;*-carbon:
	1. **carboxyl functional group** -COOH ionizes to -COO<sup>-</sup>
	1.  **amine group** -NH<sub>2</sub> ionizes to -NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>
	1. **R side chain**
* Amino acids can appear as optical isomers with **D- for righthand** and **L- for lefthand** configurations. (d-amino acids for the Latin *dextro*; l-amino acids for the Latin *levo*). Only L- configurations appear in nature / are used by living cells with the [rare exception of some structural proteins used in bacterial cell walls](http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/bioprop/landd.html).
* See Table 3.2 on p. 44 for good categorization of 20 amino acids based on R side chains.
* Amino acids are combined using a condensation / dehydration reaction that forms a **peptide linkage**. The N- terminus all the way on the left of the protein is by considered the "beginning" of the sentence and the C- terminus all the way at the right end is considered the "end" of the protein "sentence".
* Primary structure is the sequence of repeating -N-C-C-N-C-C-
* Good diagram of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quartenary structure on p. 46.
* Each monomer is an amino acid. A short sequence of amino acids is called a **peptide**. Multiple peptides together form polypeptides and protein subunits.
* Concept of [molecular chaperones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_(protein)) which help guide proper folding of proteins directly after peptide synthesis or after denaturation to refold. Cancer cells produce chaperones to help secure proper folding for cancer-promoting proteins (p. 51). See p. 51 also for example of HSP60 cage + lid.

#### Secondary structure of proteins
* *&#945;*-helices are right-handed and the R-groups extend outward from the central axis of the -N-C-C-N-C-C- chain in a steady spiral. Coiling results from the hydrogen bonding between the small &#948;<sup>+</sup> of the H<sup>+</sup> on the N and the &#948;<sup>-</sup> on the carbonyl oxygen C=O of another amino acid in the chain.
* Pleated  *&#946;*-sheets

#### Tertiary structure of proteins
* Definitive 3D structure of a protein, which usually includes a polar (hydrophilic) exterior region and nonpolar (hydrophobic) interior where reactions happen.
* &#945;-helices and  &#946; pleatedsheets secondary structures are determined by hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, tertiary structure is caused by nonovalent interactions between the **various -R side chains functional groups** hanging off the central polypeptide -N-C-C-N-C-C- . Examples:
	* Covalent disulfide bridges
	* Hydrogen bonds between side chains
	* Hydrophobic side chains an aggregate together in the interior of the protein. These close interactions are stabilized by van der Waals forces.
	* Ionic bonds can form salt bridges between positively and negatively charged side chains.
* p. 48 interesting example of how [Christian Anfinsen used ribonuclease A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfinsen%27s_dogma) to prove that primary structure contains all the info needed to determine tertiary structure.

#### Quartenary structure
* When a protein consists of two or more polypeptides, called **subunits**, each of these subunits fold into their own tertiary structure.
* The interaction of these subunits is the **quartenary structure**.

### Carbohydrates - p. 51
* Usually have the generic formula C<sub>m</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>O<sub>n</sub> where m,n &#8712; {positive integers}.
* Carbohydrates have important roles in energy storage/transport and structure like cellulose in plants. 
* *Chemically modified carbohydrates* also play critical structural roles in biology:  
	* **galactosamine** is a major part of cartilage (p. 55)
	* a derivative of **glucosamine** is a component of chitin which is important in arthropods and fungi.
* Four categories of carbohydrates based on number of monomers:
	1. **Monosaccharides** like glucose
	1. **Disaccharides** like sucrose, a combination of glucose and fructose
	1. **Oligosaccharides** are made up of about 3-20 monosaccharides
	1. **Polysaccharides** are made up of hundreds or thousands of monosaccharides. Examples: starch, glycogen, cellulose.

#### Monosaccharides
* In living systems, most monosaccharides are the dextro- / D- / (right-handed) optical isomer.
* *Pentoses* are five-carbon sugars, including [ribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribose) which is part of the sugar-phosphate backbone of RNA and [deoxyribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose) which forms the sugar-phosphate backbane of DNA.  
* *Hexoses* are 6-carbon sugars such as glucose, fructose, mannose, and galactose.
	* **Glucose** are 6-carbon sugars that can take the form of straight carbon chains or rings in chair configuration. The ring consists of 5 carbons and an oxygen; the 6th carbon hangs off of the ring at the 5-carbon.
	* Glucose comes in [both &#945;- and &#946;-isomers](https://www.worldofmolecules.com/3D/what-is-the-difference-between-alpha-and-beta-glucose.html) which convert to each other readily in aqeous solution and are in equilibrium.
* Dehydration synthesis reactions connects monosaccharides into disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides via [glycosidic linkages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosidic_bond)

#### Polysaccharides
* Whereas all proteins are linear chains of amino acids, monosaccharides can bond in many branching ways to form polysaccharides.
* **Starches** are polysaccharides which are often [branched](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Polysaccharides) made up of glucose monomers via with &#945;-glycosidic linkages. 
	* These branches attach from the via 1-&#945; carbon of glucose monomer A to either the 4 or 6 carbon on the glucose molecule B.
	* Starch is the primary energy storage for plants. Some plant starches are unbranched like [amylose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylose) which can consist of 300-3000 (or even more) monomeric glucoses.
* **Glycogen** is highly branched and used in animals. 
	* Similarly to starch for plants, glycogen acts as an energy store for animals in the liver and in the muscles. 
	* The branches occur every 10-14 glucose monomers between the carbon 6 of the main branch and the 1-&#945; carbon of the branched glucose. See this [Wiki link on the brancher enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_branching_enzyme#Function) for more.
	* Unlike glucose which is readily soluble in water, glycogen is nonpolar and thus does not dissolve in water which relieve osmotic pressure in animal cells allowing more compact storage. 
* **Cellulose** is a critical componet of plant cell walls. Connected via glycosidic linkages at the 1-&#946; carbon (instead of the 1-&#945; carbon seen in starch and glycogen). This makes it much harder to break down cellulose.
* Chemically modified carbs which have undergone redox reactions and/or had functional groups like phosphate, amino, or N-acteyl gropus added. Cartilage and chitin.
* Also refer to carbohydrate panels in Alberts 5th, p. 112-113.

### Lipids and phospholipids - p. 56
* Types of lipids
	* Fats and oils (triglycerides) store energy.
	* Phosopholipids provide structure to membranes.
	* Carotenoids and chlorophylls capture light energy for plants.
	* Steroids and modified fatty acids play regulatory roles as hormones as vitamins.
	* Fat in animals provides thermal insulation
	* Myelin (fatty sheath) surrounding neuronal axons provide electrical insulation to speed the action potential.
	* Oil and wax on the surface of skin and leaves helps repel water and prevents excess evaporation.
* Simple lipids like fats and oils consist of **triglycerides**. 
	* A triglyceride typically combines an alcohol (like glyceryl with 3 -OH hydroxyl groups) with three fatty acids which are simply long chains of hydrocarbons. 
	* The glycerol and fatty acids are bonded by 3 dehydration/condensation synthesis reactions that yield 3 water molecules.
	* The resulting bonds are ester linkages with a central oxygen between each fatty acid and the glycerol molecule.
	* Saturated fatty acid = full of hydrogen atoms, no double bonding
	* Unsaturated fatty acid = some missing hydrogen atoms *aka* some double or triple bonding somewhere.
* **Phospholipids** are amphipathic; have a polar phosphate end and a nonpolar hydrocarbon chain end.
* **Carotenoids** are a family of light-absorbing pigments found in plants and animals. &#946;-carotene aka betacarotene is part of the photosynthesis process for plants. Meanwhile, betacarotine breaks down to two vitamin A molecules for humans as part of the visual system.
* **Steroids** are multiply linked rings of hydrocarbons that are important as membrane components as well as signals in the hormone system.
* **Vitamins** A, D, E, and K are lipids, aka they are fat soluble.
* **Waxes** are hydrophobic and at room temperature, malleable/plastic. Each wax molecule sonists of a saturated long-chain fatty acid connected via an ester linkage to a long-chain alochol. As such, they have between 40-60 CH<sub>2</sub> groups.
* Lipid panels in **Alberts 5th Ed**, p. 114-115
	* Stearic acid (C18) and palmitic acid (c16) are saturated aka full of hydrogens and only carbon single bonds.
	* Oleic acid (C18) is unsaturated with a single double bond between C9 and C10.
	* Glycerol is a 3-carbon alcohol with an -OH hydroxyl attached to C1, C2, and C3 respectively. It serves as the backbone for triglycerides when 3 fatty acids attach via dehydration/condensation synthesis at the ester linkage.
	* Carboxyl groups -COOH give rise to: (a) ionized form -COO<sup>-</sup>, (b) esters, (c) amides.
	* Phospholipids where one of the 3 fatty acids attached to the glycerol backbone is replaced by a hydrophilic  **phosphate group -PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>** . Thus forming a hydrophilic head and 2 hydrophobic tails. 
	* The phosophate group can also attach to other moeities, such as choline in the example of [phosphatidylcholine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylcholine).
	* Isoprene units like [2-methyl-1,3 butadiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprene). See also the [Organic Chemistry section](/organic-chemistry/).


## Chapter 4: Macromolecules II - Nucleic Acids (p. 62-76)
* See [notes on Alberts 5th edition](/alberts-5e) 

## Chapter 12: Inheritance, Genes, Chromosomes (p. 232 - 258)
* p. 234 - Character is a phenotypic attribute and a trait is a particular value for that attribute.
* A gene can have more than 2 alleles in the population. Example of the C gene in rabbits that determines rabbit coat color (p. 242):
	* The dominant wild-type *C* allele produces a dark gray coat
	* *c<sup>chd</sup>* recessive allele produces a [Chinchilla coat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchilla_rabbit)
	* *c<sup>h</sup>* recessive allele produces a Himalayan coat aka [point coloration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_coloration#In_rabbits_and_rodents) where color is restricted to ears, feet, and other tips.
	* *c* recessive allele produces an [albino rabbit](https://www.cuteness.com/article/albino-rabbits) with white fur.
