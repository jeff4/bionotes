## Chapter 4: Creatures Void of Form
* p. 45-46, Louis Pasteur, Robert Koch, and Joseph Lister
* p. 46: **fission fungi** aka [*Schizomycetes*](https://doi.org/10.1007/0-387-30843-1_392) coined by [Carl von Nägeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Nägeli) in 1857 as a class in Kingdom Plantae.
* [Ferdinand Cohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Cohn) (1828–1898)  seems to have first used the term "bacteria" in the modern sense in his 1872 paper *Research on the Bacteria*. p. 47
	* Other contributions. Helped Robert Koch with anthrax bacillus life cycle, isolation of dormant spores, etc.
	* p. 48: Cohn's studies of heat resistance of spores might have contributed to the end of abiogenesis (doctrine of spontaneous generation) even more than Pasteur's work
	* Cohn pushed for people to see bacterias not just agents of disease but the foundation of all life on earth
	* Cohn disagreed with Haeckel (who thought that bacteria and blue-green algae formed by spontaneous generation). Cohn agreed with [Charles Wyville Thomson's](Wyville Thomson) speculations on [panspermia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia) p.. 49


## Chapter 6: Kingdoms at Biology's Borders
* Edwin and Herbert Copeland were a father-son pair of biologists 
* [Edwin Copeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Copeland) (1873–1964)  p. 72 taught at University of the Phillipines and originally began a classication system that placed bacteria in an independent kingdom as early as 1914. 
	* However, Edwin did not publish this until a small note in a 1927 issue of *Science*and it did not gain notice until his son Herbert published another monograph in 1938 with a complete taxonomy in *Quarterly Review of Biology*.
	* Interestingly, it was considered obvious that bacteria and blue-green algae (aka Phylum Schizophyta) still belonged to Kingdom Plantae in the 1920s-30s.
	* "'a plant kingdom comprised of all the organisms listed in the texts of botanical taxonomy is no more &#8216;natural&#8217; than a kingdom of the stones.'" p. 72
	* "[Edwin Copeland] suggested there might be other kingdoms [beyond bacteria]. He reassured botanists that to grant bacteria a kingdom of their own would not reduce botany's holdings. 'These various creatures do not disappear from the course in botany just because they are not plants.' **Botany was 'still the most convenient place to study them'.**" p. 72
	* "Convenience aside, Copeland asserted, 'there is no other one thing so important in systematic biology as the fact that the grouping of organisms reflects and expresses their true relationships. It is inconsistent and unreasonable to begin the course in botany by doing violence to this basic principle.'" p. 72
* [Herbert Copeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Copeland) (1902–1968) p. 72
	* "'When it became my turn to [teach elementary biology as my father had once taught me and many other introductory students], my efforts to recognize a series of natural kingdoms led me to distinguis four of them, called Monera, Protista, Plantae, and Animalia.'" p. 73

### The Map is Not the Territory
* [**Anastomosis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis#Evolution) - when edges in a network start from a small set of nodes, branch out into many nodes, and then converge back again into a small set of destination nodes. Somewhat like arteries and veins in the human body. p. 76 
* Edwin Copeland believed that phylogenetic evolutionary trees did *not * exhibit anastomosis; "natural systems consist of lines which divide, diverge, and redivide, and are incapable of anastomosis." p. 76 
* Edwin Copeland's three conventions of constructing taxonomic systems:
	1. **"Natural groups" are formed by common descent and a prepondarance of common characters indicating that descent.** p. 77
		* For example, "because the plant and animal kingdoms posessed such characters they were undoubtedly natural groups."
		* "The Protista was a natural group; its members include the original form of nucleated life and all of its descendants except those two specialized secondary developments, the familiar kingdoms of plants and animals."  In modern parlance, we would call Protista a monophyletic taxon.
	1. **Paraphyletic groups were not allowed.** 
		* First the delimitation of any particular group assigned a taxonomic category was "always artificial, arbitrary, and decided by convenience." But, one could not cross phylogenetically divergent lines.
		* Edwin did not believe any of the seven common ranks (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species) were objective categories determined by nature.
		* In contrast, [Alexander Agassiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Agassiz)  perceived the seven ranks (kingdoms...species) to be "realities, facts of nature; they were natural kinds to be discovered, *not* invented categories" probably because of his belief in divine categories as opposed to Darwinian gradualism
		* Copeland wrote of Agassiz "We know that he was mistaken. All taxonomic groups are parts of a branching system considered separately  for purposes of human thought." p. 77
	1. **The type method**
		 * A group is named with a specific "paragon" example representing the group. "The type meant the exemplar of the group whose members possess many but not all group characteristics. As Copeland put it, 'it was a standard and allowed for diversity within the polythetic group."
		  * Another rule related to the type method was the importance of *priority*, i.e., recognizing the oldest valid name and only that name. On this basis, Edwin Copeland in 1947 abandonded the terms protista and monera because he had come to learn of Richard Owens' and John Hogg's earlier proposals as well as Haeckel's exemplar of Protoamoeba turned out to simply be a broken-off fragment of a whole amoeba. p. 77
		
### The New Systematics
* In 1940, [Julian Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Huxley) published *The New Systematics* which had contributions from 22 biologists across many fields but did not include microbiologists. p. 80
* The Modern Synthesis also did not incorporate microbiology *or* embryology/development (p. 78 and see Chapter 6, footnote 40 - p. 336 and Sapp 1987).
* *The New Systematics* (1940) and Ernst Mayr's *Systematics and the Origin of Species* (1942) both included "discussions of the philosophical and methodological principles of taxonomy. What is meant by 'natural classification'? Are such taxonomic categories as species, genus, and family artificial creations of the systematist, merely matters of convenience, or are they real natural groups with an objective reality? Could and should taxonomy be based on phylogeny? Can the course of evolution be visualized as a tree? To what extend is the course of evolution reticulated?

### Are Species Real?
* "The problem of conceptuatlizing species was characterized by the dispute between Darwin and Agassiz, a lifelong opponent of the theory of evolution. For Agassiz, species were real, natural types around which individual variations occurred; they were the 'thought of God'."
* "For Darwin, like Lamarck before him, species were not real–if real meant eternal or immutable, or if the boundaries between them had to be sharp." p. 80
* **More interesting quotes from p. 80 - 84**
