## Chapter 2: Trees
#### 2.1.1 Tree terminology p 11-12
* "A** tree** is mathematical structure which is used to model the actual evolutionary history of a group of sequences or organisms. the actual pattern of historical relationships is the **phylogeny** or **evolutionary tree** [or *pedigree* for humans/domesticated animals or *family tree*]."
* A tree consists of **nodes** connected by **branches** aka **edges**.
	* **Terminal nodes** represent sequences or organisms for which we have data; they may be either currently existing or extinct. Terminal nodes are also called **leaves**, **leaf nodes**, or **OTUs** (Operational Taxonomic Units).
	* **Internal nodes** represent hypothetical ancestors; the ancestor of all sequences that comprise the tree is called the **root** of the tree.
* A **weighted tree** is a tree whose branches are drawn such that branch length (aka edge length) imply the amount of time that has passed.
* The number of branches connected to a node indicate the **degree of the node**. For the most part, this book seems to use tree (mostly) in the computer science sense of a [rooted directional tree data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)). 
* Polytomies
	* If a node has a degree greater than three (i.e., the node is connected to one ancestor node and more than 2 immediate descendant nodes), then this node is referred to as a [**polytomy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytomy).
	* If a tree has no polytomies, it is referred to as **fully resolved**. 
	* Polytomies can represent two rather different situations: (1) First they may represent simlutaneous divergenceâ€“all the descendants evolved at the same time, aka a *hard polytomy*. (2) Secondly, they may represent uncertainty about phylogenetic relationships; the lineages did not necessarily all diverge at once, but we are unsure as to the actual order of divergence; this is called a *soft polytomy*.
	* Typically, polytomies are treated as soft.
