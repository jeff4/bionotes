## Chapter 2: Trees
#### 2.1.1 Tree terminology p 11-13
* "A **tree** is mathematical structure which is used to model the actual evolutionary history of a group of sequences or organisms. the actual pattern of historical relationships is the **phylogeny** or **evolutionary tree**" [aka *pedigree* for humans/domesticated animals or *family tree*].
* A tree consists of **nodes** connected by **branches** aka **edges**.
	* **Terminal nodes** represent sequences or organisms for which we have data; they may be either currently existing or extinct. Terminal nodes are also called **leaves**, **leaf nodes**, or **OTUs** (Operational Taxonomic Units).
	* **Internal nodes** represent hypothetical ancestors; the ancestor of all sequences that comprise the tree is called the **root** of the tree.
* A **weighted tree** is a tree whose branches are drawn such that branch length (aka edge length) imply the amount of time that has passed.
* The number of branches connected to a node indicate the **degree of the node**. For the most part, this book seems to use tree (mostly) in the computer science sense of a [rooted directional tree data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)). 
* Polytomies
	* If a node has a degree greater than three (i.e., the node is connected to one ancestor node and more than 2 immediate descendant nodes), then this node is referred to as a [**polytomy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytomy).
	* If a tree has no polytomies, it is referred to as **fully resolved**. 
	* Polytomies can represent two rather different situations: (1) First they may represent simlutaneous divergenceâ€“all the descendants evolved at the same time, aka a *hard polytomy*. (2) Secondly, they may represent uncertainty about phylogenetic relationships; the lineages did not necessarily all diverge at once, but we are unsure as to the actual order of divergence; this is called a *soft polytomy*.
	* Typically, polytomies are treated as soft.

#### 2.1.2 A shorthand for trees
* Uses parentheses. See JH notes, Bio #3, 1/28/2021.

#### 2.1.3 Cladograms, additive trees, and ultrametric trees
* Different kinds of tree can be used to depict different aspects of evolutonary history.
* The most basic tree is the **cladogram** aka **n-tree** which simply shows relative recency of common ancestry. For example, given three sequences A, B, and C, a cladogram shows when each sequence diverged from the other. (See Figure 2.5 on p. 14)
* **Additive trees** (aka **metric trees** aka **phylograms**)contain additional information, namely branch length or edge length. The number associated with each branch (aka edge) correspond to some attribute of the sequences, such as the amount of evolutionary change. In the example shown in Figure 2.5, sequence A has acquired four substitutions since it shared a common ancestro with sequence B. 
* **Ultrametric trees** aka **dendrograms** are a special subset of additive tree. Here, all the tips of the trees are quidistant from the root of the tree. This kind of tree can be used to depict evolutionary time, expressed directly as years or indirectly as the amount of sequence divergence using the molecular clock.

#### 2.1.4 Rooted and unrooted trees p. 16
* Cladograms and additive trees can be either rooted or unrooted.
* A **rooted tree** has one particular node identified as the root from which ultimately all the other nodes descend, hence a rooted tree has a direction. This direction corresponds to evolutionary time; the closer a node is to the root of the tree, the older it is in time.
* An **unrooted tree** does not have an explicitly named root node. However, this does not mean no root exists "in reality"; we simply don't know where to place it on the diagram. As such, there is a set of *possible* rooted variants all represented by this single unrooted tree. See Figures 2.6 and 2.7 for more detail (p. 17).
* Many methods of reconstructing phylogenies generate unrooted trees as output. In other words, the output implies many different rooted trees are possible. In order to root an unrooted tree (i.e., to decide which of the seven trees from Fig 2.7 is the correct interpretation of the unrooted tree shown in Fig. 2.6), we need some other source of information.
* Note that ultrametric trees are rooted by definition.
* See Chapter 6 for more on how to root unrooted trees.
* See Table 2.1 (p. 18) to see how many unrooted and rooted trees are possible given x number of OTUs, sequences, species, or organisms are leaf nodes.
